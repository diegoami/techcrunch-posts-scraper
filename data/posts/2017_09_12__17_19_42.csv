Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Dropbox continues to tune its products as it tries to tap a bigger audience within larger companies with some updates today to its collaboration tool Paper, including the ability to preview documents before loading them.
As a blank slate, Paper is increasingly popular with designers you might talk to in Silicon Valley. It basically turns the process of designing and building a product spec into a living, breathing flow of information online. As such, Dropbox seems to have started to recognize the opportunity of catering to these users as it starts the drip-drip-drip of incremental product updates to suit those popular needs.
Here’s a quick rundown of what’s getting updated today: users are able to create folders on their mobile devices and move Paper documents into them; they can now delete or archive their Paper documents on their phones; finally, users can now preview Paper documents before opening them. All of these seem to be on the smallish side, but they’re worth noting as Dropbox is a company that touts its simplicity and has to take care not to feature creep a product like Paper.
Dropbox is also giving developers a way to create or edit Paper documents in their own apps, which is a move that will potentially move the product outside of the bounds of the traditional Dropbox experience. But this is also important because it gives third parties which are accustomed to working on these kinds of documents in their own environments a way to do that with Dropbox.
That’s a perpetual danger for any company that tries to lean on its brand as a simpler product, especially as the company tries to break into a mainstream enterprise tool that has to cater to dozens of different team requirements. Dropbox’s challenge is building a more generalized, abstract version of the collaboration tools you might find in other massive products.
It’s going to need to do just that as the company seems increasingly primed for an IPO. The company is reportedly following all the incremental steps toward going public. It’s inevitably going to be compared to companies like Box or Microsoft, but with an origin story as a consumer product, it has to provide a unique pitch if it looks to become a full-fledged business that’s able to tap both consumer and enterprise demand.",2017-08-30,1533753,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dropbox-paper-beta.png?w=738,mobile/,paper,Dropbox Paper gets document previews and some other small updates,"microsoft,box,dropbox-inc",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/dropbox-paper-gets-document-previews-and-some-other-small-updates/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"Those betting big on AI making voice the dominant user interface of the future are not betting so big as to believe their respective artificially intelligent voice assistants will be the sole vocal oracle that Internet users want or need.
And so Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos are today announcing a tie-up, which will — at an unspecified point later this year — enable users of the latter’s Alexa voice assistant to ask her to summon Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant to ask it to do stuff, and vice versa.
Here are the pair’s respective statements on the move:
And here’s how they sum up the win-win benefits they see for their respective users by letting their voice assistants interoperate:
The main thing to note here — aside from how clumsy it’s going to be having one voice assistant summon another — is that Cortana and Alexa play in very different spheres; one being productivity and business user focused, and the other being ecommerce/entertainment and consumer focused.
Which means there’s little strategic reason for Alexa or Cortana to be overly territorial vis-a-vis each other at this point vs — on the flip side — the extra utility they reckon they can reap by agreeing to integrate their products and expanding the relative capabilities of each.
So really this alliance is mostly a commentary on the slender individual utility currently offered by each/any of these heavily hyped voice assistant technologies.
In an interview about the tie-up with The New York Times, Bezos envisaged a future where people are turning to different AIs for different areas of expertise — akin to asking one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.
“I want them to have access to as many of those AIs as possible,” he is quoted as saying.
Bezos also professed himself open to the idea of interoperating with Apple’s Siri and Google’s eponymous voice AI — although he confirmed neither had been approached.
And, to be clear, there seems zero chance of Apple and Google inking on the interoperability line, given they control the two dominant mobile ecosystems and therefore have different strategic ecosystem priorities vs Amazon and Microsoft (the two companies which, let us not forget, lost out in the mobile platform race).
So, in sum, if you can’t beat the dominant mobile platforms, you can at least forge wider product integrations to try to offer a more compelling app proposition.",2017-08-30,1533486,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-482028705.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"cortana,micrsoft",Amazon and Microsoft agree their voice assistants will talk (to each other),"jeff-bezos,amazon",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/amazon-and-microsoft-agree-their-voice-assistants-will-talk-to-each-other/
Ron Miller,Apps,"There is a general misconception that Apple is strictly about consumer tools, but the fact is that the company has a big presence in the enterprise just by the sheer number of iPhones and iPads in the business world. It also has some high-profile partnerships with hefty enterprise vendors like IBM, SAP and Cisco. Today, Apple announced that it is building on those relationships with a brand new partnership with Accenture, the global consulting firm.
The companies plan to work together to help customers build advanced digital projects on iOS devices. Apple of course brings its iOS expertise to the table. Accenture comes into play because it understands how to connect to legacy backend systems that are lurking inside every large enterprise organization. The company has also long worked with established companies that are trying to become digital operations. Both of these are targets for the new project.
Ten years after the iPhone debuted, there are more in-house iOS programmers and more mobile development projects than ever before, but companies have struggled to take advantage of iOS to build digital tools to truly transform organizations and how they operate, according to Susan Prescott, VP for apps, markets and services at Apple.
“We’ve seen an increase in development efforts within companies. In fact, in the last three years, the number of in-house iOS developers has doubled,” she said. “So the demand is definitely there, but enterprises still need great partners to reinvent workflows and tap into backend systems.”
She adds, “This partnership with Accenture is about taking that further. What’s really exciting is that this isn’t just about optimizing existing apps and business processes — it’s about designing new apps and experiences using new technologies.”
Apple is looking to work directly with Accenture and enterprise customers to help them dig into enterprise data, and find new workflows that they have never considered before. This isn’t unlike what it has been doing (and continues to do) with IBM, but Apple says it’s going to have a seat at the table with Accenture personnel and share their expertise around iOS to help solve unique enterprise problems — and that is a big difference with this project.
As for Accenture, Gene Reznick, senior managing director for technology ecosystem and ventures for the firm, says they are looking to capitalize on some specific areas with this partnership including helping to create “engaging user experiences.” They hope to improve how organizations interact with customers in a digital way, something that continues to elude many companies. Secondly, they want to make that experience as meaningful as possible by building connections to relevant back-end systems and surfacing helpful data.
While this could take many forms, they see exploiting the burgeoning area of Internet of Things, where they could build iOS applications to help monitor large industrial machines or other complex operations from an iPad or iPhone. They could supplement this idea by building augmented reality applications with Apple’s AR development toolset, ARKit to help with training or repair assistance right on the iOS device.
For starters, the teams will work together in San Francisco, but the hope is that over time, they will expand the project and build additional teams at some subset of the 30 Accenture Studios located throughout the world.",2017-08-29,1532738,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8960.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"partnerships,accenture,ios,apple-inc",Apple and Accenture teaming up to help enterprises build advanced mobility tools,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/apple-and-accenture-teaming-up-to-help-enterprises-build-advanced-mobility-tools/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"If you like to keep on top of the latest display tech, you’re probably familiar with Ray Soneira’s exhaustive testing of the screens on the newest smartphones and other devices. His latest target is the Galaxy Note 8, and it turns out Samsung’s excellent phablet sports the best screen they’ve ever seen on a phone.
It shouldn’t come as that great of a surprise — OLED screens are the future, of course, and although early models were far from competitive, steady improvements have led to the tech leapfrogging traditional LCDs.
But don’t take my word for it. Look at that beautiful signature up top. And more importantly, Soneira’s article concludes:
Of particular interest were the phone’s multiple calibrated display modes, all of which have as good or better color accuracy than the best screens out there — but have subtle or not-so-subtle differences in how they render an image. There’s also a user-adjustable white balance setting, which photographers and anyone sensitive to color temperature will appreciate.
The full rundown of new and improved features is worth reading, so take a few minutes to check out the state of the art.
An interesting thing to think about given the surpassing excellence of the Note 8 display is whether others — particularly Apple — can challenge them. If the iPhone is indeed going to go to OLED soon, it likely wouldn’t be able to claim anything but playing catch-up, though Apple has been spinning its catch-up moves pretty well over the last few years. But although its IPS LCDs are counted among the best in the world, it’s going to be a stretch for them to say they’re superior to the competition.
Right now, however, the main problem is there just aren’t enough of the high-quality OLED units to supply everyone who wants them, let alone Apple. So it’s a bit of a moot point for the present. 2018, however, may be a very interesting one for the display market.",2017-08-28,1532442,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/samsung-galaxy-note-8-21.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"smarthph,galaxy-note-8",Tests put Galaxy Note 8 at the top of the smartphone display heap,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/tests-put-galaxy-note-8-at-the-top-of-the-smartphone-display-heap/
Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Last week, Amazon said that its massive $13.7 billion deal to acquire Whole Foods is wrapping up on Monday — giving it access to one of the strongest food brands in the United States, as well as hundreds of grocery stores in metropolitan areas.
That means it’s going to be easier and easier for people to get access to great ingredients, and there’s been a continued trickle of suggestions that Amazon will be gunning for a massive business that helped Blue Apron go public — a trickle that has since tempered Wall Street’s appetite for that business.
All this raises a ton of questions as to what the future of Blue Apron is as Amazon looks primed to bulldoze into its territory in a very Amazon move. But as the specter of Amazon getting into meal-kit delivery looms, let’s review really quickly what Blue Apron has going for it:

Still, Blue Apron’s stock fell quite dramatically again after it released its most-recent quarterly earnings report, even though the business showed some signs of life. It signaled that the company would likely continue to see losses going forward — projecting a net loss between $121 million and $128 million. Investors looking for a kind of performance like the flash of life that it showed earlier even amid a heavy burn rate to acquire customers seem likely to be disappointed in the near term as the company calibrates for a future where Amazon may go after its business.
While Blue Apron requires an aggressive marketing engine — especially as it tries to expand beyond metropolitan areas, which are probably its sweet spot — still seems primed for a product that could grow organically. One example would be that the product seems like a very natural fit for a gift for occasions like weddings, birthdays or the holidays. This seems like obvious low-hanging fruit, where it can turn around and rely on that branding and consumer experience in order to convert those customers to more long-term ones and start the cycle again.
Blue Apron can again lean on that strong brand that it’s built as one of the big anticipated consumer IPOs for 2017, even if it was a flop. Blue Apron at the beginning of 2018 — if it can last out to the holiday quarter — may end up looking like a much healthier Blue Apron at the middle of 2017.
To be sure, Blue Apron’s growth has greatly decelerated (in the same fashion most companies do as they mature), and there really isn’t a lot of data to predict that forward:

One of Blue Apron’s biggest challenges may end up being Amazon’s Prime business. The company said Prime members will soon see “special savings” when it comes to Whole Foods, which could end up being pretty much anything. Knowing Amazon, it’s likely to run a ton of experiments to figure out how to quickly quash any competitors and then decide how to grow it into a mature, profitable business later.
In the end, the drip-drip-drip of aggressive news about a potential Amazon competitor will probably continue to put a lot of pressure on Blue Apron, especially as it still seems to be racking up losses. But the company has shown that it’s willing to re-orient itself following the IPO, including making some changes in the executive ranks and some organizational changes.
And while Amazon even seems to be testing a product in the vein of Stitch Fix, that company has still filed confidentially to go public — and is going to charge forward despite the specter of Amazon. There are still a lot of things going for the company and, if it’s able to lean on what initially made it able to expose that huge business, Blue Apron may have a shot to be a company that continues to exist even if the Amazon behemoth tries to get into its market.",2017-08-27,1532012,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-803395768.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"blue-apron,whole-foods",Where does Blue Apron go after Amazon wraps up its Whole Foods deal?,amazon,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/where-does-blue-apron-go-after-amazon-wraps-up-its-whole-foods-deal/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"The Essential Phone started arriving in the hands of media and reviewers just last week, and as of today it’s now also shipping out to its first customers. Essential announced the news via its Twitter account, and told early buyers to keep an eye out for tracking info sent out via email.
Last week, pre-registered customers started getting emails asking them to provide final payment and shipping information to prepare for shipping to start soon. Essential then held a few press events to demonstrate the new device in-person.
The Andy Rubin-founded smartphone maker is selling its device directly through its website unlocked for $699, and via carrier partner Sprint in the U.S. and Telus in Canada. It opened pre-orders through each of these sellers just last week, and through Best Buy in the U.S. While Sprint and Telus are the phone’s only official carrier partners at launch, it will work with all major carriers in both the U.S. and Canada unlocked.
Essential had first announced the device would ship within 30 days in late May, but after missing that target it has remained relatively quiet on firm shipping timelines. The news that the first shipments have started to go out will likely be welcomed by the brand’s early buyers.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Apps are dominating consumers’ digital media habits, but getting people to try new ones is still a tough sell. That’s the latest from comScore’s newly released 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps Report, which finds that 57 percent of consumers’ time spent using digital media is now taking place in mobile apps. Of that, 50 percent is occurring in smartphone apps versus only 7 percent for apps on tablets.
Desktop is trailing further behind, accounting for 34 percent of time spent, while mobile web is another 9 percent.

The use of mobile apps to engage with digital media is even higher among younger users. comScore found that among those aged 18 to 24 years old, two-thirds of their digital media time is spent using smartphone apps alone. Not surprisingly, that percentage drops steadily the older the user, with just 27 percent of seniors 65 and older spending their digital media time in smartphone apps, for instance.
Beyond digital media time, the younger millennials – those 18 to 24, that is – are just heavily using apps in general. They spend more than 3 hours per day in apps, compared with 2.6 hours for 25 to 34-year olds and 2.3 hours for 35 to 44-year olds, for example.

In contrast to these findings about apps’ continued popularity and frequent usage, users aren’t rushing out to try new ones, it seems.
A majority of users (51%) still don’t download any apps in a month, says comScore.

Of those who download one or more apps on average in a month (49%), 13 percent download just one app, 11 percent download 2 apps, 8 percent download 3 apps, 5 percent download 4 apps, 7 percent download 5 to 7 apps, and 5 percent download 8 or more.
Again, it’s millennials (18-34) who are driving much of the interest in new app downloads, the report also finds. 70 percent say they’re always looking for new apps to try, and they’re willing to pay. 1 in 5 downloads an average of one paid app per month, and nearly half make five or more in-app purchases per year.

Other age groups show little interest in new apps, with only 37 percent of those 35 to 54 having interest in new and interesting apps, for example.
The majority (66%) buys zero paid apps per month, and 58% makes zero in-app purchases per year. What’s worse, they’re also often deleting the apps they already have on their devices.
While 57 percent of millennials say they download new apps more often than they delete old ones, only 30 percent of those aged 35 to 54 can say the same.
People say they remove apps because they’re just not using them, their interest has waned, their phone needed decluttering, or because they need more storage space.
This isn’t the first report to find that most users aren’t downloading new apps. comScore spotted this trend back in 2014; it came up again last year in a report released in September.
That this hasn’t changed over time is telling. It points to a sort of saturation point for apps, in terms of everyday use. Facebook and Google, which have 8 apps out of the top 10, are enough for most people.
Today, the majority of app users access 20 or fewer apps per month, and their number one most-used app accounts for half of all their time spent using apps. Their top 10 most-used apps account for nearly all the time they spend in apps. That leaves little room for newcomers.
Even breakout hits like Snapchat aren’t finding traction on older users’ phones, it appears. The apps is #3 among 18- to 24-year-olds and #6 among 25- to 34-year-olds, but doesn’t make the top 8 for any user over the age of 34.
The data almost makes it seem like there’s not much point in trying to build new apps for anyone but millennials, as they’re the only group showing serious interest in downloading more, a willingness to pay, and the ability to adopt a new app at scale.
The report also looks more deeply into other habits of this younger demographic, even noting odd tidbits like how they’ll delete apps with bad logos, how they tend to organize apps into folders, and how they position apps on their device for easy access with their thumb, among other things.
The full report is available from comScore’s website here.",2017-08-25,1531583,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/messaging-apps.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"trends,mobile,apps,comscore","Majority of U.S. consumers still download zero apps per month, says comScore",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/majority-of-u-s-consumers-still-download-zero-apps-per-month-says-comscore/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Wattpad, the social publishing platform behind apps for sharing original stories and chat fiction, is today venturing into video with the launch of a new app called Raccoon. Unlike its predecessors, Raccoon will focus on non-fiction video-based storytelling, with the goal of connecting people who want to create and watch stories that either entertain or inspire.
While Raccoon still fits within Wattpad’s broader mission of building modern-day storytelling products for web and mobile, the app feels like a more social experience. Instead of reading stories from authors whose real identities are often hidden behind handles, watching a Raccoon video is more like tuning into a YouTube vlog. The storyteller is right there on the screen, sharing something personal with you.
At launch, you can favorite stories by tapping a heart, or post them outside the app by clicking the share button, but Raccoon (perhaps smartly) doesn’t offer a commenting feature at this time.

If you want to participate in the community by posting your own video, you can click the plus sign at the bottom of the app to start recording. For those who aren’t sure what to talk about, there’s also an “I need inspiration” button that offers a story prompt.
Each week, there are new story challenges in the form of prompts. For example, this week, Raccoon is prompting users to share their travel stories. If the weekly challenge isn’t of interest, you can swipe left for more ideas, like “what’s unique about your family?,” “share a memorable childhood experience,” “share your biggest Tinder-fail,” “share a funny story that happened at work,” etc.

These stories are tagged, so you can find more of the same while browsing the app.
While recording, you can see when your video hits the 60-second mark – a subtle reminder that Raccoon wants videos that are only a minute or two long.
The app was developed out of Wattpad’s internal incubator, Wattpad Labs, which is also where its newer chat fiction app Tap got off the ground. Today, that app is the #7 app in the Books category on the App Store, just a couple of spots behind Wattpad itself. It has since grown to include over 300,000 stories. Meanwhile, Wattpad’s monthly audience is now 60 million.
However, both Wattpad apps on the App Store are trailing two other top chat fiction apps, Hooked and Yarn.
“Wattpad’s vision is to entertain and connect the world through stories, and as part of this we are constantly looking for innovative ways to evolve the storytelling process,” explains company co-founder Ivan Yuen about Wattpad’s move into video. “We know that video will play an important role in the future of storytelling and wanted to create a place where storytellers can authentically connect with audiences around shared experiences,” he adds.
The new app is designed to appeal to those aged 18 to 35. This age group, Yuen says, is already accustomed to the Snapchat’s and Musical.ly’s short, vertical video format, but are craving “more substance and meaningful connections with people,” he believes.
Raccoon has been in testing in Canada ahead of today’s launch. The app is now available in the U.S. on both iOS and Android.",2017-08-25,1531473,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/raccoon-ios-alt.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"apps,video,social,wattpad","Wattpad moves into video with personal storytelling app, Raccoon",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/wattpad-moves-into-video-with-personal-storytelling-app-raccoon/
Josh Constine,Apps,"What if you could see if your Instagrams made people happy, surprised or disgusted? That’s just one of the innovative features of new photo-sharing social network Polygram. Using facial detection, Polygram gives you analytics about the emotional reactions people have to the photos you post.
Polygram also has augmented reality makeup that lets you look more attractive instead of just silly like with masks in other apps. Plus, it’s developed a smart method of preventing screenshots where you can cover your photos like a fogged-up window, and people may only wipe clean a portion of the screen at a time.
After raising $2.1 million in seed funding, today Polygram launches its iOS app with dreams of usurping Instagram and Snapchat.

It will be a tough uphill climb, especially if the social giants copy Polygram’s emotion detection and other cool features. But co-founder Faryar Ghazanfari thinks it can grow by attracting users who want to A/B test their social media with Polygram’s facial analytics to pick what to post elsewhere.
“Influencers and content creators are the oxygen in this ecosystem,” Ghazanfari tells me. “We have white glove service for influencers, with full-time employees that just create custom features for them.” If the app can deliver enough utility and views, he thinks people might start purposefully sharing on Polygram too.
I met Ghazanfari at TechCrunch’s annual summer August Capital party. He asked about a story I wrote about Facebook acquiring a company called FacioMetrics that had researched letting you Like photos by smiling, then claimed his fledgling startup Polygram had actually built that. The demo was impressive.
With just a minimal 20 milliseconds of lag, Polygram shows a wireframe mirror of your face that recognizes a wide variety of emotions corresponding to different emoji. It relies on an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to detect how your face moves and map it to a specific emotion. As I smiled, frowned and raised my eyebrows, Polygram accurately surfaced the related emoji.

This tech is the basis of Polygram’s Instagram-ish social network. When sent a private message, you can respond with a face-triggered emoji reaction. And when you post a photo, you’ll see the emotional response tallies of your audience, though without names attached so you can’t get mad at a friend for looking grossed-out by your selfie. You also can see exactly where around the world your viewers are, and get audience breakdowns by demographic if you only care how a certain gender feels about your post.
Some extra features include the ability to post permanent or ephemeral photos and videos, with the option to make a disappearing image everlasting after you post it. There are the typical Snapchat-style face filters, but there also are more subtle ones designed to beautify you like Meitu instead of making you puke rainbows or look like a puppy.
Perhaps the savviest feature, and the one I almost hope Snapchat or Instagram copies, is Polygram’s “wipe-to-reveal.” It lets you choose to protect your private messages from screenshots.
When delivered, your friend will see a blurry image as if was behind a condensation-covered window. By wiping a finger over the photo, they clear the fog and are shown what’s underneath. But the fog quickly reappears, so only a swath of the photo is visible at a time. With enough wiping, you’ll see and remember the whole image piece by piece, but if you try to screenshot or take a photo with a second camera, only the currently visible section will be recorded. Plus, you’ll be alerted if they screenshot it, and get sent a copy of what they captured.
Starting a new social network from scratch is incredibly difficult. People have already made their connections on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. They loathe the chore of rebuilding this graph, posing a stiff challenge for Polygram.
Ghazanfari hopes to overcome this by recruiting influencers who’ll bring their own audiences with them. He says it’s already signed up a bunch who’ve been helping it refine Polygram’s features, and it wants to give them personal attention that Snapchat has notoriously denied to social media stars. “And in terms of monetization, we put these guys ahead of ourselves,” Ghazanfari declares.
But Polygram will have to sign up plenty of users to watch these web celebs, since they’ll only invest time in a platform that grows their fan base. Even with all its snazzy features, that may prove very tough, especially without much funding for traditional marketing.
Still, if Polygram’s app fails to gain mass traction, I’d bet its slick interface ideas will live on, whether it’s copied or acquired by the social juggernauts.",2017-08-25,1531440,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/polygram-facial-detection.png?w=738,mobile/,selfie-masks,Polygram detects facial reactions to shared photos,"instagram,snapchat",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/polygram/
Taylor Hatmaker,Apps,"Anyone haunted by annoying link cruft will be relieved to hear that iOS 11 will transform Google AMP links back into their original forms when sharing a story from Safari. MacStories editor Federico Viticci first spotted the change, which appears to be live in the new iOS 11 beta 7.
Google’s fast-loading AMP pages are ideal for platform-agnostic consumers looking for a quick read, but publishers tend to loathe them (with good reason). Pointing users toward Google domains instead of canonical links limits a publisher’s opportunities to drive further engagement by keeping a user on-site, hindering things like newsletter signups and subscription services that can be powerful monetization options for publishers.
Earlier this year, Google announced that AMP links now load twice as fast thanks to image compression improvements and other under the hood tweaks. For the rest of us who favor purity over unbridled speed, this little iOS 11 change is just one more reason to look forward to September.",2017-08-23,1530802,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/safari-ios.jpeg?w=738,mobile/,"ios-11,ios,google-amp","In iOS 11, Safari will strip out Google AMP links for shared stories",apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/ios11-google-amp-safari-canonical-links/
Matthew Lynley,Mobile,"VIPKID, an online English teaching tool, announced today that it has raised $200 million in financing. That financing round values the company at $1.5 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.
That wouldn’t just give VIPKID unicorn status — it also exposes a huge amount of demand there is in China and other countries as a tool to learn English from English speakers. VIPKID had raised $100 million in financing in August last year and already seemed to have quite a bit of momentum at the time. This financing round was led by Sequoia Capital, including a strategic investment from Tencent.
VIPKID is a play that taps into the growing need for training in English in China. While that’s the sweet spot for VIPKID right now, a service like this has natural applications in other countries as well. But at the moment, China is such a big market that it can already support a company with a $1.5 billion valuation that started in 2013. It’s become one of the largest resources of English tutoring for children and has attracted venture interest from basically all directions.
If you haven’t heard of VIPKID out in our little Silicon Valley bubble, it’s probably for the reason above: it’s huge outside of the U.S. The company said that it has more than 20,000 teachers delivering lessons to 200,000 paying students from 32 countries. It also said it had monthly revenue of $60 million in July this year and is projecting annual revenue of $750 million. Including this round, VIPKID has raised $350 million in venture financing.
VIPKID fills an interesting niche that helps English speakers — whether teachers or other professions — put in a bit of time to make a little extra money on the side. It’s a unique twist on the education model, putting it closer to an Uber model. There are other spins on online foreign language education like Duolingo, which raised $25 million at a $750 million valuation in July this year, but it seems like VIPKID has tapped into some kind of use case at the right time to get the attention of investors.
VIPKID founder Cindy Mi’s longtime focus on teaching English basically morphed into a platform that’s tapped into growing demand amid an increasingly global economic environment.

John Biggs,Mobile,"Body sensors have long been bulky, hard to wear, and obtrusive. Now they can be as thin as a Band-Aid and about as big as a coin. The new sensors, created by Kyung-In Jang, professor of robotics engineering at South Korea’s Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, and John A. Rogers, Northwestern University, consists of a silicone case that contains “50 components connected by a network of 250 tiny wire coils.” The silicone conforms to the body and transmits data on “movement and respiration, as well as electrical activity in the heart, muscles, eyes and brain.”
This tiny package replaces many bulky sensor systems and because the wires are suspended in the silicone you are able to create a denser electronic. From the release:
The researchers can power the device wirelessly which means it can sit almost anywhere on the body. Further, the team expects to be able to use this system inside of robotics where a softer, squishier connector is needed.
“Combining big data and artificial intelligence technologies, the wireless biosensors can be developed into an entire medical system which allows portable access to collection, storage, and analysis of health signals and information,” said Jang. “We will continue further studies to develop electronic skins which can support interactive telemedicine and treatment systems for patients in blind areas for medical services such as rural houses in mountain village.”",2017-08-22,1529834,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/148448_web.jpg?w=738,mobile/,robot,"New wearable tracker can transmit vital signs from a soft, tiny package",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/new-wearable-tracker-can-transmit-vital-signs-from-a-soft-tiny-package/
Brian Heater,Hardware,"Google officially just took the wraps off of Android Oreo, but there are still some questions left to be answered — most notably, precisely when each device will be getting the latest version of the mobile operating system. Due to Android’s openness and a variety of different factors on the manufacturing side, it’s not an easy question to answer, but we’ll break it down best we can. 
First the good news: If your device was enrolled in the Android Beta Program, you’ll be getting your hands on the final version of the software “soon,” according to Google. Exactly what that means remains to be seen, but rest assured that you’ll be one of of the first people outside of Google to take advantage of picture-in-picture, notification dots and the like. 
No big surprise, Google handsets will be the first non-beta phones to get the update. The Pixel, Nexus 5X and 6P are at the top of the list, alongside Pixel C tablet and ASUS’s Nexus Player set-top box, which will be receiving the upgrade in spite of being discontinued late last year. 
Beyond that, the answer differs greatly from company to company. In most cases, the latest flagship is a no-brainer for an upgrade, and there may even be a handful of devices announced at IFA in a few weeks that will ship with the update out of the box. We’ve reached out to the manufacturers to find out what to expect. 
BlackBerry: A spokesperson for TCL/BlackBerry told us, “I can confirm that BlackBerry KEYone will get the upgrade.” No date listed. 
HTC: Similarly, a spokesperson confirmed that the U11 will indeed be getting Oreo eventually, though, “We haven’t announced timing yet. More info to come in the future.”
LG: The company is certainly bullish about the new operating system, tweeting out an Oreo/eclipse teaser ahead of the event. Compatibility seems like a no-brainer for the forthcoming V30, along with recent flagships, though the company has yet to confirm
Motorola: Motorola is similarly committed to bringing Oreo to its flagships, but sounds even more cautious with regards to timing. “Once Android O is fully released,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch, “we will begin working on the new code for our devices – as always, we know upgrades are about getting it right and making sure the phone performance remains the best it can be.”
OnePlus: The company has already semi-officially announced that the new OS will arrive on the 3 and 3T this year— presumably the OnePlus 5 will be getting it around then, as well. 
Samsung: As always, Samsung does things on its own schedule — though it seems pretty likely that the big flagships, including the S8 and the forthcoming Note 8, will get it. Perhaps we’ll hear more on the latter at this week’s Unpacked event. 
Sony: The company has yet to issue an official statement with regards to when its Xperia line will be getting the upgrade, but the Xperia X, XZ and XA seem like likely first candidates.
We’ll be updating this story as more manufacturers respond to our request.",2017-08-21,1529254,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/android_oreo.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"android-oreo,android-o","So, when will your device actually get Android Oreo?","android,google",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/so-when-will-your-device-actually-get-android-oreo/
Matt Burns,Mobile,"Google just announced Android Oreo and it packs a handful of new features. Some are at the system level and speed up the system and extend the battery life, while others are features that will change the way users interact with their phone.
A lot of these features should be familiar to iPhone and iPad owners. Normally Apple is the one accused of copying Android, but for Android Oreo, Google lifted a handful of features straight from iOS, while a couple of new functions are hitting Android before iOS.

Google cribbed iOS for Android’s new notification scheme. In Android Oreo there will be a little dot in the top-right corner of the app’s icon to represent a notification. This has been a staple in iOS since the first iPhone and third-party Android launchers have long featured the scheme, too.
Google even copied how users interact with the notifications, too. A long press on an icon with a notification badge reveals a pop-up menu that presents the user with several tasks — just like an iOS 3D Touch interaction.
In the end, it’s a win to the user that Google copied this system. These dots have survived numerous iOS revisions for a reason: they work.
 
Both Android Oreo and iOS 11 are getting new emojis because emojis are the future of humanity. And Google completely redesigned their take on emojis for Android Oreo. Gone are the blobs and traditional, round emojis have returned.
Google’s new emojis follow Apple’s move to increase the detail found on the little faces. Yet according to a preview by Apple’s Tim Cook, iOS is about to get emojis that are even more detailed.
This tweet by Apple’s CEO shows emojis with a crazy level of detail. Apple has yet to say when the new characters will hit iOS, but it’s logical to expect them in the general release of iOS 11 and High Sierra.
Android has supported copy and paste functions from the first release and has often led iOS’s implementation of the user interaction. It’s a critical function, yet the small screen size of phones often means copy and pasting is a clumsy affair. Android Oreo now makes it even easier to copy text and perform an action.
Called Smart Text Selection, when a user highlights, say an address, a link to Maps will be displayed next to the standard actions of copy, cut and paste. If a series of digits that looks like a phone number is highlighted, the phone app will be displayed.
This is sort of like how data detectors work in iOS, but Google’s feature looks to be more comprehensive, and it’s powered by Google’s AI for smarter identification.
Apple added picture-in-picture to the iPad in iOS 9 and Android is now gaining the capability, too. But with Android Oreo, phones can get in on the PiP action, too, which is something missing from the iPhone.
Android Oreo’s PiP mode works as expected. It allows users to minimize a video and let it float on top of the screen while other tasks are performed behind it. This video window can be moved around the screen to best position it.
Right now iOS limits this process to the iPad, though that could change in the future.
Android Oreo finally brings the ability to have apps auto-fill user information like user names, passwords and addresses. Password manager apps have long performed some of these functions, but through convoluted means. Apps can now implement the Autofill API so the interaction should be much more seamless.
iOS kind of has a similar function, but it’s mostly reserved for a few apps, like Amazon’s, and it’s not nearly as omnipresent as it is in Safari on the web.",2017-08-21,1529008,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/google-android.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"oreo,android-oreo",Android Oreo vs iOS 11: What’s different and what’s the same?,"android,google",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/android-o-vs-ios-11-whats-different-and-whats-the-same/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Sony just announced a new camera called the RX0, but breaking from the trend of lower number = fancier camera, this one is a tiny device that combines an action-cam form factor with some traditional imaging prowess. It’s an unusual combination, yet somehow tempting.
The waterproof, shockproof RX0 has a 1-inch, 15-megapixel (cropped down from 21) sensor and a 24mm-equivalent F/4 lens, which right off the bat differentiates it from GoPro cameras, which generally have smaller sensors with super-wide-angle, relatively slow glass in front. But it lacks a zoom and many of the other useful features of a pocket camera like the RX100. So you’re not going to be walking around taking snapshots with this thing.
It seems that the RX0 is being put forth as a sort of modular system for videographers who need the ruggedness and versatility of a GoPro but want a bit more control and fidelity. B cameras on set and outside (depending on the image quality), shooting from multiple angles (multiple RX0s can sync together), super slow-mo footage (it goes up to 960 FPS), and so on.
While its $700 price tag might be a bit much for people who just want a camera to attach to their bike or surfboard, there are plenty of people who would opt for the RX0 instead of a GoPro.
It’s an odd little device, no doubt, but the more I think about it, the more I feel I’d prefer it for non-traditional duties. It’ll be available in October.",2017-08-31,1534696,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/dsc-rx0_front_top_us01.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"ifa-2017,cameras,photography,sony",Sony’s RX0 is a tiny camera with big ideas,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/sonys-rx0-is-a-tiny-camera-with-big-ideas/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Apple just sent out invites for its annual iPhone event, which is taking place on September 12 at its new Cupertino HQ, at the Steve Jobs Theater it built there specifically to host special events. It’s expected that Apple will reveal a brand new iPhone with a nearly bezel-free design on the day.
TechCrunch previously reported that the event would fall on this day, confirming WSJ’s sources. This will be the first ever event at Apple’s new headquarters, and the dedicated theater, which is actually built partly underground with an entry in a glass covered rotunda at ground level.
At the event, we’ll likely see the new iPhone, which sources say is a premium priced option to be sold alongside updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (likely 7s and 7s Plus models). Reports also suggest we’ll see an updated Apple Watch, possibly sporting its own built-in LTE connection, as well as a new 4K-capable Apple TV.
We’ve seen a lot of evidence about what’s coming, through the HomePod firmware leak, and reports including one from Bloomberg this week that outlines exactly how the iPhone interface will work without a home button, but Apple should still have plenty to reveal that we haven’t seen at this event, including at least a few amazing ARKit demos.
Of course, TechCrunch will be there and bringing you all the news as it happens from the Steve Jobs theater on September 12, so check back then for updates.",2017-08-31,1534568,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-9-07-24-am.png?w=738,gadgets/,,Apple sets iPhone event for September 12 at new Steve Jobs theater,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/apple-sets-iphone-event-for-september-12-at-new-steve-jobs-theater/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"It seems like everyone these days has a multi-room speaker system – the latest entrant is Marshall, the amp maker that brought its signature style to portable consumer speakers in recent years. The speaker maker is introducing three new models today, each of which packs Wi-Fi connectivity and multi-room capabilities.
The Acton, Stanmore and Woburn multi-room models go up in size from compact to quite large, and each resembles the classic vintage Marshall amp styling that the company is known for. The Acton is $350, the Stanmore is $450 and the Woburn is $600, and features two 5.25-inch woofers along with 110 watts of output power.
Each of these speakers support Chromecast out of the box, as well as Spotify Connect and AirPlay so you’re covered regardless of which devices or music service you want to use. That means you can add them to an existing Chromecast-based multi-room audio setup, too, which is great news for anyone already working with Google Home or Chromecast hardware.
You can also set up Marshall’s own Multi-Room connectivity via the Marshall Multi-Room app (perfectly named), which houses settings for audio EQ, LED lighting, and more as well. Presets correspond to dial options on the speakers themselves, which allow you to set immediate access to streaming of favorite (or hated, I’m not here to judge) artists, playlists and albums.
Many speaker makers now offer similar systems, including Sony, Brookstone and more, but Marshall’s distinct style is likely to be an added draw for some. The Marshall Wireless Multi-Room lineup is up for pre-order starting September 1, and will go on sale in stores on September 27.",2017-08-31,1533955,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/marshall_mr_family_black_2294_arm_highres.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,marshall,Marshall introduces its own Wi-Fi multi-room speaker system,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/marshall-introduces-its-own-wi-fi-multi-room-speaker-system/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"SanDisk has a new record-breaking microSD coming to market, which will deliver so much storage you might be at a loss as to what to do with it all. The new 400GB SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I card is the world’s highest capacity card of its type, and is ideally suited for use in Android smartphones that feature an expansion slot.
Android’s most recent versions allow you to adopt microSD-based storage as “native internal” storage, which allows you to use it to install apps, store photos and more as if you were using a built-in flash memory drive. Most recent Android devices that offer a microSD slot will support the new 400GB chip out of the box, meaning you can get your phone up to almost double what the top-end iPhone currently offers in onboard storage.
The SanDisk 400gb microSD card can hold up to 40 hours of 1080p HD video, Western Digital notes, and offers transfer speeds of up to 100mb/s. It’s also designed to comply with the A1 App Performance Class specification for flash memory, which means it can load and run apps faster when operating as adopted internal storage.
Even though it offers so much added storage, the price won’t break the bank – at $250, it’s actually very reasonable for in terms of price to storage ratio. It also comes with a 10-year limited manufacturer’s warranty, and should be available soon via SanDisk directly and all the usual retail suspects.

Matt Burns,Gadgets,"Everyone wants to get in on the wireless earbud rage and two firms just announced their entry into the market. Today at IFA 2017, B&O and Sony announced their first wireless earbuds that each compete in the space Apple made popular with the AirPods. Sound quality aside, these new earbuds have one thing over the AirPods: They don’t look like AirPods.

The B&O Beoplay E8 sports a four-hour battery life and is constructed out of aluminum, stainless steel, and textured rubber. The case is covered in leather. B&O says the ‘buds have been tuned with the same system used in the rest of its headphone line so hopefully the sound quality can justify the $299 price.

Sony’s WF-1000X will cost $199.99 and have a three-hour battery life. These earbuds connect through Bluetooth or NFC, the latter which makes it very easy to connect compatible devices.
Both models have modes that allows the wearer to pipe in noise from around them so the wearer is not isolated from the outside world. Sony calls this Ambient Sound and B&O calls it Transparency Mode.
Even though these models sound respectable, when compared to AirPods spec-for-spec, things start to fall apart even when the extra features are considered. AirPods have longer battery life and a smaller case that’s also able to be tracked by the Find My iPhone app — all for $159. Plus, for Mac users, AirPods can effortlessly be used on the computer and a phone.
The market is exploding with these wireless earbuds yet so far it seems few have been able to stand apart. Bragi’s Dash Pro and Hear One are some of the favorites used by TechCrunch staff though a handful have Apple AirPods, too. And that’s how it’s supposed to be.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"If you still have a functional SNES console, or one of the myriad third-party devices that plays actual SNES cartridges, you probably want to rush out and pre-order this limited edition Street Fighter II SNES cartridge celebrating the game’s 30th anniversary.
The newly manufactured cartridges will number only 5,500 in total, including 4,500 in ‘Opaque Ryu Red,’ and 1,000 in ‘Translucent, Glow-in-the-Dark Blanka Green.’ The cartridges feature the actual original game code, and are playable on NTSC region SNES consoles.
Other things you get in the box include a fancy tri-fold holder, a premium instruction booklet, some ‘retro surprises’ and a fully restored package design.
These are selling for $100 each, which is admittedly almost 10 times more than you’d pay if you picked up a used copy at a local vintage game shop or on Amazon. But it’s priced for collectors, and it’s also officially blessed by Capcom itself, which worked with iam8bit on the release.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Ricoh has revealed a brand new version of its Theta 360-degree camera: The Theta V, which upgrades the video capture quality to 4K resolution, adds live streaming support, and immersive “surround” sound audio recording. It takes over as the flagship Ricoh 360 camera, adding some much-appreciated modernized touches to one of the oldest and best-loved lines of consumer 360 cameras around.
The Ricoh Theta V also has a new high-speed wireless radio for faster data transfer, boosting it up to 2.5 times faster vs. the existing version. It also includes improved exposure and white balance accuracy, and boosted dynamic range, which Ricoh says should result in far better image quality in all lighting situations. The improved imaging tech was borrowed from the Pentax line of DSLRs, the company says.
It can capture 14 megapixel stills in addition to the 4K video, and comes with a built-in 19GB of flash storage, which can keep up to 4,800 static images or around 40 minutes of 4K video, which is recorded in a format using the H.264 video codec. You can connect to the Theta V from your smartphone using the companion app, either via Bluetooth LE for remote control, or via Wi-Fi for when you also want to transfer over photos and videos to your phone.
Another new feature unique to the Theta V is software plug-in support, which means Ricoh can add features to the camera over time. The first feature to take advantage of the plug-in system is a remote playback function, which allows mirrored playback from the camera directly to compatible connected TVs and other smart streaming devices.
Spacial audio capture is also a pretty cool thing to add directly in the camera itself, which isn’t found on many of the Theta V’s more modern competitors. It’s something we need to test before rendering a verdict on, but it could be great for VR viewing in particular.
Ricoh will also sell a separate mic add-on for $269.99 that captures 3D audio, presumably at higher quality, and there’s an underwater housing which will also ship separately and provide protection up to 100 feet (30 m) deep.
The Ricoh Theta V will sell for $429.95, and goes on sale at Ricoh’s website and the usual suspects today. The microphone is also on sale now, and the underwater housing is going to ship in October and retail for $199.95.
Ricoh’s competition has improved a lot since the original Theta was introduced in 2013; the Insta360 One, which launched earlier this week, is a prime example of how far we’ve come. But the Theta V sounds solid, and Ricoh has one of the best track records around when it comes to consumer 360 cameras, so this should be a strong contender once it ships.",2017-08-31,1533826,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/imgp0730.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"insta360,ricoh,ifa-2017","Ricoh’s new Theta V 360 camera offers 4K, spatial audio and more",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/ricohs-new-theta-v-360-camera-offers-4k-spatial-audio-and-more/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Garmin has three new wearable devices it’s debuting at IFA 2017, including the vivosport GPS-enabled activity tracker, the vivomove HR hybrid touchscreen smartwatch and the vivoactive 3, a smartwatch with Garmin Pay, which supports Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards to enable mobile payments on the go.
The Garmin vivoactive 3 includes GPS, a heart rate monitor, and battery life of 7 days in smartwatch mode, and 13 hours if you’re using constant GPS tracking. It comes in three different colors, and supports both built-in sports apps for up to 15 different activities, as well as additional user-customizable activity apps. The vivoactive can keep track of stress levels over time thanks to heart rate variability monitoring, and additional watch faces, apps and more are available in the Garmin Connect IQ store, which is accessible via the companion smartphone app.

Garmin’s vivoactive 3 also features the Garmin Chroma display, which pairs sunlight readable transflective screen tech with backlighting for visibility at night, too. The standout feature, however, is the new Garmin Pay support, which allows for contactless payments via Visa and MasterCard cards from a range of major U.S. banks. Garmin Pay is powered by FitPay, which is a platform designed specifically to help bring mobile payments to mobile and IoT devices, without requiring direct, separate negotiations with the banks and issuers.
The vivomove HR is Garmin’s first hybrid touchscreen smartwatch, which means it blends a traditional analog watchface with a built-in digital sub-display. The watch offers much more subtle styling vs full-digital screen devices, but still can display notifications from your smartphone, as well as activity data and heart rate. It comes with both leather and silicone strap options, and different case materials including a higher end stainless steel finish.

Vivomove HR can also monitor stress throughout the day, and works with the Garmin Connect Mobile app. It retails for $199.99, and $299.99 for the upgraded version.
Finally, the vivosport is a smart activity tracker, focused more on fitness functions, but offering up to 7 days in smartwatch mode and up to eight hours in GPS mode. It’s got a slim deign focused on lightweight wearability, and uses that always-on power efficient Garmin Chroma color touchscreen tech for its display.

Built-in apps will track walking, running, biking, cardio and strength training, and the Garmin Move IQ feature will automatically categorize and record lots of activity in case you forget. There are also notifications via vibration included from your smartphone, as well as remote control for a Garmin VIRB action camera if you happen to have one of those.

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Smart knobs have a short and not very illustrious history, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t cool. That, at least, appears to be the thinking at Logitech, which has just added a smart knob (or dial if you’d rather) to its newest wireless keyboard. The Crown, they call it — and the keyboard it sits on is The Craft. Well, they don’t capitalize it that way, but I do.
Basically the Crown lets you control a variety of settings or interface elements depending on the app: Zoom in Photoshop, exposure compensation in Lightroom, column in Excel, and so on. We’ve seen things like this here and there, and Logitech’s is a respectable specimen: understated in design and compatible with major apps out of the box.
Now, to be honest, comparisons to Microsoft’s Surface Dial aren’t really warranted. That one is context-sensitive based on where you place it as well as what app you’re in. It’s meant to turn the Surface Studio into a sort of cyborg creation engine as you wield the pen in one hand and dial in the other.
The Crown is more like someone wrote a script that mapped the volume dial on a keyboard to identify as a human interface device input when you open certain apps. Not exactly groundbreaking, but if you’re buying a wireless keyboard, why not get one with a sweet knob?
The Craft and the Crown, which sounds like a bar that’s too expensive for me to drink at, will cost $199 when it hits stores in October.",2017-08-31,1534169,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/thecrown.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"ifa-2017,logitech","Logitech’s latest keyboard, The Craft, adds a smart knob called The Crown",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/logitechs-latest-keyboard-the-craft-adds-a-smart-knob-called-the-crown/
Natasha Lomas,Artificial Intelligence,"Libratone, a Danish maker of snazzy high end wireless speakers, has announced its existing Zipp and Zipp Mini speakers will get support for Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant via a free app update, slated to arrive this fall.
This means existing owners of the speakers will be able to jump aboard the smart speaker craze — and use their Libratone Zipps like an Amazon Echo and ask Alexa to do stuff like look up sports scores, tell a joke, provide a weather update or indeed order something from Amazon.com.
Although — unlike Amazon’s Echo speakers — the Libratone Zipps do not have built-in microphones that are persistently listening for a trigger word.
The company confirmed that users wanting to talk to Alexa will therefore have to manually touch a button on the top of the speaker to do so. So while the quality of Libratone’s audio is more premium than Amazon’s Echo speaker hardware, its existing microphones (previously used to support a conference call functionality) aren’t as tuned for this use-case — ergo there will be more friction between you and Alexa’s ‘lazy web’ answers to your voice commands.
(Or more privacy safeguards between you and Amazon’s data-harvesting AI, depending on your perspective.)
Rival speaker maker Sonos had already been expected to unveil its own voice play on October 4. And according to an FCC filing, Sonos intends to introduce support for multiple voice assistants to existing speaker hardware.
But Libratone’s opening gambit here is to start with just Amazon’s Alexa as its chosen partner for ‘smartifying’ its premium hardware.
Asked why it’s adding Alexa Libratone’s president, Mike Culver, told TechCrunch it had noticed some customers already using their Zipps with Amazon’s entry level Echo Dot device — so seeking to control their Zipp via Alexa voice commands sent to the ever-listening Dot.
“We started investigating additional integrations that would make sense based on the consumer demand — for the Amazon Alexa capabilities, but available in a much better quality sounding speaker, which is why they’re purchasing Zipp and Zipp Mini and pairing it with the Echo Dot,” he said. “That was the stimulus.”
“Then when we looked at the bigger picture we fundamentally believe that one of the key interfaces, from a usability standpoint for our speakers, should evolve to include voice. It’s a natural way to interact with our speakers and with music. And we believe the speaker also serves as a natural integration point to the smart home.
“So both of these led us to integrate with Amazon,” he added.
What happens if a customer does not want their speaker to be turned into an Amazon-enabled listening outpost? Culver said that while the user does not have a choice to decline the firmware update, they would need to take additional steps to actually enable and activate Alexa. And thus could choose not to.
“After the Libratone Zipp or Zipp Mini speaker have the firmware update for Amazon Voice Services, the user will need to use the Libratone App to enable and configure it,” he confirmed. “The Libratone App will include a step that will take you to the Alexa App (and require you to download it if you do not already have it), where you will register the Zipp/Mini speaker for use with Amazon Voice Services.  Afterward, you will be passed back to the Libratone App for final confirmation.” 
Culver also noted that as part of the Alexa App registration a user would have to accept Amazon’s privacy policy, since they will be using Amazon’s voice services. Though, again, Zipp owners not wanting to agree to their personal data being processed by the ecommerce giant can do so by avoiding registering for the Alexa app.
“All of our updates require the customer to authorize the update to the speaker… And once they update — and we’re always doing updates so eventually all the speakers will have this capability — they still have to configure it for it to start working,” added Culver, further emphasizing that even users who do configure Alexa still have to manually touch a button on the top of the speaker and say the word “Alexa” to summon the AI.
Therefore, he said, Libratone will not be updating its own privacy policy ahead of this impending update as it does not believe it needs to.
“That’s the difference between farfield microphones, that are just continuously listening, vs the way we’ve implemented it — which is based on the use-case that the customer has to intentionally want to do this. They have to touch the bird [logo on the button on top of the speaker] and at the same time give the Alexa voice command,” he added.
“We are planning to add the possibility to disable [the Alexa integration] from within the Libratone App if customers wish to do so,” he also noted.
Culver would not comment on whether Libratone is planning to launch any new speaker models in future with the Alexa AI baked in from the get-go plus microphone hardware that is always listening.
“This is what we think is a really good first step,” he added. “And we’re always studying voice as a user interface — and I think all the questions that you’re asking are the same ones that we’re continually asking ourselves… so we’ll see how this [space] evolves both in implementation as well as with other competing voice services in the future.”
In another integration twist, Amazon and Microsoft yesterday announced a forthcoming tie-up will enable users of Alexa to summon Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant, and vice versa. So, in future, it may end up that enabling one voice assistant means being able to get in touch with any of them — at least, that’s Jeff Bezos’ prediction.
In the meanwhile, Libratone owners enabling the Alexa integration can certainly look forward to being able to ask the AI to summon Cortana too — if they really want to use their speaker to update their calendar or check something in Outlook.
For now it looks like the immediate future of voice interfaces will be voice assistants nested within voice assistants — in an attempt to make the technology more useful. Let’s just hope all these various vocal summons don’t result in cacophonous confusion of AI assistance.

Catherine Shu,Gadgets,"When Google Home was unveiled, many people immediately noted the smart speaker’s striking resemblance to a home fragrance diffuser. Now there’s a smart home fragrance diffuser that looks like a smart speaker. Pium, a self-described “next-generation smart diffuser,” is currently participating in Samsung Electronic’s Creative Square incubator program. Visitors to IFA 2017 can demo it at Samsung’s booth. Pium also recently ran a successful Kickstarter campaign.
While other diffusers that can be controlled with a mobile app already exist, Pium’s creators say they see their product as a gateway to a new user interface experience. In fact, the startup is already exploring ways to use its technology in virtual reality platforms, too.
Pium comes in two styles (the Brooklyn, which looks very much like a smart speaker, and the more diffuser-ish Chelsea) and can be voice-operated with actual smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo. It is also compatible with Philips Hue smart lightbulbs and Sonos speakers.
The company was founded by Ryan Kihm, Jay Hwang and Wes Yoon. Before launching Pium, Kihm and Hwang worked on the invention team of a Seoul-based accelerator, helping early-stage startups develop their IP portfolios. While doing research, the two determined that olfaction, or the sense of smell, is set to become the subject of “the next big UX technology,” Kihm told TechCrunch in an email.
“The U.S. home fragrance market is about $6 billion, but still customers just rely on their personal preferences and advertisements to pick a product. Many options are on the market, but people still don’t know how to choose one,” he said.
Scented candles often contain potentially harmful ingredients like benzene, but essential oils can also be confusing to use. Pium’s software analyzes data to understand what associations people attach to different aromas and make personalized recommendations. Its diffuser uses pods pre-filled with essential oil blends. Kihm says this not only give Pium a source of continuous revenue after selling the diffuser, but is also more convenient for its customers because they don’t have to mix oils themselves or clean their Piums.
Just as importantly, pods also let Pium have more control over user experience. Pium’s system selects different scents to release based on the time of day (for example, it can diffuse lavender-based scents at night before switching to something more invigorating in the morning) and detects its users’ locations so it can turn on automatically before they arrive home.
In the future, Pium also plans to offer a subscription service that automatically ships new blends to customers when their pods start running low. The diffusers are currently available for pre-order and are being tested at Bodyfriend HQ, a cafe and lounge in Seoul.",2017-08-30,1534234,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/brooklyn.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"fragrance,diffuser,pium",Pium’s smart diffuser wants to design a new user experience for your nose,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/pium/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Launching a product and company from scratch is hard, as fresh-faced entrepreneurs and Kickstarter successes often learn to their chagrin. And it turns out even heavy hitters like Andy Rubin and his mobile startup Essential have unpleasant lessons to learn — in this case, about how even a small detail like a mailing list configuration can put your entire company at risk.
The error appeared earlier this week as some customers were asked to send a photo ID to Essential to complete their orders. When they did, that information was inexplicably forwarded to the whole list of customers, about 70 of them, who had been asked to do so in the first place.
	
The problem was resolved, but for a young company purporting to fix a lot of the problems in today’s mobile and tech landscape, such an amateur error is hardly an auspicious beginning. What are we to think about their attention to detail in other important areas?
Rubin decided to address this potential crisis of confidence with a post on the Essential blog.
After a bit of preamble in which he established how hard it is to be Andy Rubin, a founder who must make “thousands of micro-decisions” to keep the company “laser-focused” he got around to the apology part:
He then returns to what it’s like to be a founder — although this time it’s to say that “occasionally you have to eat crow. It’s humiliating, it doesn’t taste good, and often, it’s a humbling experience.”
But not always!

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Soft robots are a major area of research right now, but the general paradigm seems to be that you pump something (a muscle or tube) full of something else (air, fluid) causing it to change its shape. But a robot from Swiss roboticists does the opposite: its little muscles tense when the air in them is removed. It’s cool — but it also looks kind of gross.
I mean, come on:
Each little section has several muscles, each of which can be contracted to different degrees to twist that section and exert force in some direction. All in one direction and the bot bends over; do it rhythmically and it can walk, or at any rate wriggle along. Or the vacuum could be let out in a suction cup, allowing the bot to attach securely to a wall, as  you see up top.
It was developed by Jamie Paik and Matt Robertson at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), who describe it in a paper published in the new journal Science Robotics.
And although other robot-like devices have used vacuum for various purposes — we had one on stage that used vacuum to safely grip fragile items — the researchers claim this is the first bot that works entirely by vacuum. The contractive action created by the vacuum isn’t just unique, it’s practical, Paik told me in an email.
“Compared to expanding actuators, contraction is more similar to the function of biological muscle,” she said. “Without going in to more precise and detailed mimicry, this might be functionally enough an advantage in terms of applications; to mimic real muscles in cases when you’d like to work with/augment/assist body joints (as in wearable devices), and not introduce other modes of forces or motion that might impede natural function.”
It’s also totally modular, so if you want fingers or an arm made out of them, that works, and a huge, horrible snake of them is an option too. (I’d prefer you didn’t.)
“The full range of geometry and performance possible is still under investigation, but many other shapes have been tested in our lab, and the general idea is still open to many more,” wrote Paik. “Ultimately, this modular kit would be a household staple tool to automate objects or execute simple but diverse tasks (holding a nail while hammering, cleaning a refrigerator overnight, looking for lost objects around the house). Or it would be building blocks for an active wearable robots that can assist/give feedback to the user.”
Currently that testing is all manual — you have to assemble each piece and test it by hand — but the team is working on automated tools that could virtually assemble and test different configurations.
The downside of this technique is that, because vacuum pumps aren’t exactly lightweight or portable, the robot must remain tethered to one.
“Pneumatic pumps have not been optimized for portability, since they are usually used in fixed settings,” Paik explained. “Hopefully these will improve as quickly as quadrotor technology has.”
It must be said that it’s not quite as sexy as a drone you can fly in your backyard, but if Paik and Robertson’s ideas pan out, this could be a precursor to a technology as ubiquitous as those drones.",2017-08-30,1533380,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_4267-1.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"soft-robotics,epfl,robots",This vacuum-activated modular robot is equally nasty and neat,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/this-vacuum-activated-modular-robot-is-equally-nasty-and-neat/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Google is hoping to catch up with Alexa’s reach by putting its Assistant on a wide range of third-party hardware. At IFA, Google announced that it’s going to be putting the Assistant on partner speakers, appliances, connected cameras, and much more.
That’s likely to be good for both the voice-powered assistant market, as well as for Google’s ability to use its service to collect useful data which it can then use to work on its advertising and marketing products. The more places Assistant appears, the more likely it is that people will engage with the voice companion, and that’s not territory Google wants to cede to someone like Amazon.
Some of the devices getting Google Assistant coming to IFA include the Anker Zolo Mojo, a small cylinder speaker that’s sort of like a third-party Google Home, which will go on sale in late October. Two other smart speakers powered by Assistant, including the Panasonic GA10 and the TicHome Mini, are also on their way.
Google is also now making it possible to use Assistant to check on the state of your laundry or dishes, using an integration with LG’s line of home appliances, which also includes voice commands for LG’s Roomba competitor.
This is definitely turning into an integration arms race for voice-powered assistant providers. Amazon and Google have strong motivation because of their data-focused business, but it’ll be interesting to see how Apple plays the game once its HomePod debuts with Siri support – I have a hard time imagining the iPhone-maker will put Siri on third-party hardware.",2017-08-30,1533588,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/anker-zolo.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,anker,"Google Assistant coming soon to more speakers, appliances and other devices",google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/google-assistant-coming-soon-to-more-speakers-appliances-and-other-devices/
Matt Burns,Gadgets,"The home button is headed to the trash bin, if a report by Bloomberg is to be believed. According to the report, Apple is ditching the button to make room for a larger screen in one version of the next iPhone. Instead of a home button, users will perform actions using on-screen gesture controls involving a sort of dock of icons.
If true this would be the biggest change in iPhone design since the launch of the device in 2007.
The home button has been a staple in iPhone design since the beginning. It’s used to wake a device, return to the app grid, and, more recently, for Touch ID fingerprint recognition. All those tasks would be performed differently if removed. However, the Bloomberg report carefully states only the high-end version of the upcoming iPhone is losing the home button, which jibes with other rumors from the past few months.
Instead of pressing a home button, users would interact with a thin software bar that can be moved around for different actions. Drag it to the middle of the screen to open the phone, or if in an app, activate the multitasking menu. Users can change apps or go back to the home screen, Bloomberg says. And it shouldn’t end there. If this report is true, Apple likely has cooked up all sorts of logical interactions for this software bar.
Apple has been foreshadowing the removal of the home button for some time. For the iPhone 7, it replaced the button with a non-moving version that simulated a click through with tactile response. The iPad also recently gained an app menu reminiscent of OS X’s dock. Bloomberg uses this as an illustration of the upcoming iPhone changes.
This is just part of what’s set to be a radical redesign of the next iPhone. Other rumors state the iPhone could mute notifications when you’re looking at it, include face scanning technology that works even when the phone is on the table, and include a screen that fills the frame of the phone except for a little notch that houses sensors, cameras, and earpiece.
It’s rumored that Apple is preparing to launch three versions of the next iPhone. It’s unlikely all versions will lose the home button for several reasons. The iPhone is Apple’s best-selling device and the removal of the home button is likely to be met with controversy. There’s no reason to rock the boat for everyone. Plus, the high-end version of the next iPhone will likely have much slimmer margins than an upgraded iPhone 7. Apple has long used incremental updates combined with bi-yearly design changes to keep margins healthy and it’s unlikely that will change. However, following this formula, the home button will disappear from all versions in following releases in 2018 or 2019.

Devin Coldewey,Crowdfunding,"We don’t do a lot of Kickstarter posts because the outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns, especially hardware ones, are notoriously unpredictable. But it’s with an easy conscience that I recommend Lomography’s new instant film camera; I backed the company’s last one, the Automat, and it’s been fantastic. This one looks similarly fun, and shoots in a larger format.
The Square has a funky folding-bellows design, which gives it a sort of Polaroid SX-70 vibe. It’s a good thing it folds, too, because otherwise the camera would be even more of a beast. The Automat focused on compactness, but it could do that because it shot on Instax Mini; I’ve grown to love the little ones but I can’t say I’d mind a little extra space to work with either. Moving up to the larger Instax Square means the camera has to be bigger in a few ways.
Nevertheless it’s a clever way to do it, this bellows system, which by the way Lomo assures potential buyers is made of a very tough rubber that won’t wear out or tear. The build quality on my Automat is great (much better than Lomo’s Diana F+ and instant back I have from a couple years back) so I’ll trust them on this.
These little instant cameras are super fun and everyone who sees them wants one — I say this from experience — but they’ll be satisfied with an instant photo of themselves doing something dumb. They always are.
And if you’re worried about operating a film camera, don’t be — once you get a basic sense of the zone focusing (basically near, medium and far) you’re ready to shoot. There are advanced features like multiple and remote exposure, but 99 percent of my shots are just basic snaps. The photos themselves have that somehow endearing muted look, though unmixed primaries do pop.
There’s only one real caveat, which is that Instax Square is disproportionately expensive compared with Mini. A single cartridge holding 10 shots costs $14 on Amazon, while a twin pack (20 shots total) of Mini costs a little less than that, or even less if you just go in for a big pack of them. Not to mention Mini is available in many stores, while Square will be harder to find. So be ready to shell out a bit for the film and stock up when it’s on sale.
They’ve already doubled their goal so there’s no chance they don’t ship. And if you order quick you can get a camera for a $129 early-bird price instead of the $149 or $179 via ordinary pre-order discounts — it’ll eventually go for two hundo, so if you’re on the fence, think about that.",2017-08-29,1533279,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/lomoinstant-square_mood.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"photography,lomography",Go big and go analog with the Lomo’Instant Square camera,kickstarter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/go-big-and-go-analog-with-the-lomoinstant-square-camera/
Devin Coldewey,Entertainment,"A handful of tech companies have just been given Emmy awards for a variety of behind-the-scenes accomplishments. Yeah, I didn’t know it was a thing either! Well, I kind of knew — as with the Oscars, it’s the “Sciences” part of the “National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.” They just don’t play it up a lot. But it’s still a little weird to see Apple win one for Siri, Microsoft win one for Skype and… Comcast win one (its third!) for its X1 remote. Really?!
I don’t mean to downplay their glory. It’s just that I hadn’t considered some of this really deeply embedded tech as something that would even be considered for an Emmy. Clearly I’m just ignorant, but in my defense it’s not so simple as better-known “Best sound design” or what have you.
This year, for instance, there was an award for “A Three Dimensional Doppler Radar System to Track and Display Fast Moving Pitched and Hit Balls.” Congratulations to TrackMan, MLB Advanced Media and ChyronHego!
So really, these are a less structured way of commending those companies and people who make possible all the amazing stuff we see on TV these days. Did you enjoy all those sweeping shots in Game of Thrones? Well, someone had to make that possible! In this case it was DJI, John McGraw, Flying Cam Inc. and half a dozen others who shared the “Low Latency Remote Controlled Airborne Video Platforms (non-military) for Television” award.
Microsoft’s Emmy was for “Development of Integrated Consumer Video Conferencing Service into Broadcast Production Environments and Workflows.” That stuff isn’t easy.
Apple, Comcast, Nuance and Universal Electronics were all honored for “Contextual Voice Navigation for Discovering and Interacting with TV Content.” You know: “Siri (or whoever), show me crime shows.” I recall Xbox doing this stuff a long time back, so I’m not sure quite why they’re not here. Actually, it looks like Microsoft got one a few years ago for “Television Enhancement Devices.” And one the year before that for gestures.
Comcast’s award was for its voice-capable X1 remote, and last year the guy who led the project (among many others) won the lifetime achievement award. How about that!
Well, there may not be a red carpet for the award recipients here, but it’s nice to know that these highly specific, indeed occasionally obscure, technologies are being recognized by the Academy.",2017-08-29,1533242,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/emmys.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"comcast,dji","And the Emmy goes to… Apple, DJI, Microsoft and Comcast (?! 💁)","microsoft,apple",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/and-the-emmy-goes-to-apple-dji-microsoft-and-comcast-%f0%9f%92%81/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Google’s App Engine service, one of its longest-running public cloud computing platforms, is finally getting a fully featured firewall.
Until now, developers couldn’t easily restrict access to their applications on the service to only a small set of IP addresses or address ranges for testing, for example. Instead, they had to hard-code a similar solution into their applications and — because those requests would still hit their applications in some form — even those rejected requests would still incur costs.

Now, they’ll be able to use the Google Cloud Console, App Engine Admin API or even the gcloud command-line tool to set up access restrictions that block or allow specific IP addresses. Because the firewall obviously sits in front of the application, rejected requests never touch the application and App Engine never needs to spin up an idle resource only to then reject the request.
For the most part, there are no surprises in how the App Engine firewall works. You set your rules, order them by priority and you’re good to go.
App Engine already offered a denial of service protection service that allowed developers to blacklist IP addresses and subnets, but with the launch of this new firewall into beta, Google recommends that developers use the App Engine firewall for protection.
App Engine was probably a bit ahead of its time. Because it forced developers into a completely new model, it never caught on while more traditional virtual machine-based services like AWS’s EC2 thrived. Now, however, thanks to the popularity of containers, microservices and serverless platforms, the App Engine model doesn’t feel quite as unusual anymore and chances are that we will see Google invest a bit more into the service again.",2017-08-24,1530981,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/appengine.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,app-engine,Google’s App Engine gets a firewall,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/googles-app-engine-gets-a-firewall/
Ingrid Lunden,Automotive,"As automakers ramp up their connected car initiatives, a company that has built a solution to link vehicles up to mobile networks globally has raised a significant round of funding from a group of investors that includes Audi and Qualcomm.
Cubic Telecom, a startup out of Dublin, Ireland, that has built a virtual networking solution that lets cars (and other devices) automatically connect to service providers in whichever country they happen to be, has raised $46.5 million.
This round values Cubic Telecom at €180 million ($215 million), according to sources close to the company.
Barry Napier, Cubic’s CEO, said in an interview that the funding will be used to expand its team — today the team is 80 percent engineers and the company is planning to hire more — and to expand its solution into new markets, specifically China and the rest of Asia, and the US.
In addition to strategic investments from Audi and Qualcomm, this Series C round also includes backing from Valid Soluciones Tecnologicas SAU and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), along with other unnamed investors.
If you have observed the world of tech and telecoms in Europe in the last several years, Cubic may be a familiar name to you. The company has been around since 2007, originally founded by Pat Phelan (who then went on to found an identity management company called Trustev, acquired by TransUnion).
It made a name for itself originally as a “virtual” mobile network provider that provided a solution for mobile users to make calls when travelling that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. (We also highlighted it back in the day at our first-ever Battlefield-style pitch event.)
In more recent years, though, roaming is something that regulators, carriers and app makers have worked on fixing for mobile consumers. In some regions you have roaming price caps; in others people buy “travel” packages ahead of their journeys; in other cases users simply opt to make calls via apps that bypass carrier call charges altogether.
And so Cubic has shifted its focus to other “hardware”, like cars, that have their own sets of hurdles when it comes to global connectivity.
As Napier describes it, typically when automakers manufacture connected cars, they have to arrange network agreements with carriers in each country where those cars are rolled out into the market. Each deal comes with its own SIM (similar to phones), and its own associated labor, time and operational cost.
Cubic’s proposal is to solve that with a software-based solution using an eSIM (working with Valid, another strategic investor) that is pre-loaded into the car at the point of manufacture.
Then, when the car is sold into one country or another, the car automatically links up to a local network to run its connected car services. That local network link-up is also part of Cubic’s offering: to date, it has mobile voice and data deals with 30 mobile operators covering over 180 countries.
“We are pleased to strengthen our partnership by participating in this latest funding round, said Dr. Peter Steiner, managing director Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, in a statement. “By utilizing Cubic’s technology we are able to offer seamless Audi connect services to our customers in many countries all over the world without roaming costs and volume limitation.”
The company has been working with Audi — which is part of the Volkswagen Group, one of the biggest car makers in the world that also owns brands like Porsche, SEAT and Skoda — for some time already, and Napier said it is on track to have its tech in some 1 million cars.
“Our ‘connected intelligence’ platform  has been growing between 23 percent to 25 percent every 55 days this year,” he said. “Our software has updated over 500,000 cars this year via OTA (over the Air) and we will hit over 1 million cars this year live.” In terms of active users, he said Cubic sees 600,000 unique automotive customers on its platform per month.
Other OEMs that Cubic works with point to how it is also positioning itself in the larger IoT trend. They include HP, Lenovo, Panasonic, Rakuten and Woolworth’s. And it’s building its connectivity also into processors from Qualcomm as part of that larger opportunity.
To date, Cubic has raised $83.5 million in funding.",2017-08-24,1530882,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/audi-barcelona-a8-interior-nvidia-technology.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"cars,automobiles,connected-cars,cubic-telecom",Cubic Telecom gets $46.5M to connect cars and other devices globally,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/cubic-telecom-gets-46-5m-to-connect-cars-and-other-devices-globally/
Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"As companies get bigger and bigger, their needs are going to change — including, probably most importantly, their options for health care as their employee base expands and the costs of those plans start to balloon. But the end result is that employees could be presented with a confusing set of plans to pick from without a whole lot of guidance.
There’s where Lumity comes in. The startup looks to provide employers with tools that optimize health care costs and simplifies the approach to picking a healthcare plan for their employees. The end product is a screen with around four boxes that an employee can choose a health care plan, which makes sense as companies reach into the hundreds or thousands of employees and the process of signing on gets more and more complex. Lumity said today it raised $19 million in a financing round led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson to help build out efforts to attract customers, which already include Lyft and GoFundMe.
“We take on primary employee support,” Lumity co-founder Tariq Hilaly said. “We deal with all employee questions, we deal with all the enrollment technology, and deal with all the data analytics. We put in place a set of plans that are better for the employees, and essentially reduce the cost of plans without compromising the benefits quality through using things like prescription data.”
One example is prescription data, which Lumity customers can voluntarily submit in order to help plan out their best health care plans. At first, Hilaly and the team weren’t 100% sure that employees would want to opt-in and share that data. But around 90% of the employees on the platform have actually opted into the service, which has given Lumity more data to chew on as it continues to refine its algorithms.

“Data obviously has a flywheel attached to it,” Hilaly said. “The more you get, the better the models, and then the better the outcomes. We’re taking the benefits problem and applying both a technology and a service component. It involves interfacing with lots of different systems. I think that, certainly as the complexity and the breadth of what we do have expanded, the moat around it has expanded.”
The company last raised financing in September 2015, and since then, it’s continued to gather more data on its customer base. That’s a requirement for companies that look to predictive analytics to help manage risk and determine the best health care plans, especially in the face of a lot of potential competition from regional brokers that have a lot of experience and expertise. Lumity has to ensure that virtuous cycle — get more data, create a better experience, and then use that experience to convert new customers — continues if it’s going to stay alive.
Lumity’s pitch is that the company won’t necessarily lock you into a single platform. That’s part of the reason why Hilaly says companies would pick it over a product like Zenefits, which given that it targets the benefits space would likely be one of its strongest competitors. Zenefits, however, targets multiple different employment areas for companies — which makes sense for smaller companies but not necessarily as they grow into larger ones.
“They’ve taken those three things, put them in a bundle, and probably for companies under 100 employees that might make sense,” Hilaly said. “In our market, it starts at around 100 and then goes up, people are less concerned about that all-in-one. They have different needs and systems. They might want ADP for payroll, for example. As they get larger, some may want to use Workday. We don’t focus on trying to build an all-in-one, we don’t focus on trying to lock you into our platform. We focus exclusively on benefits, that’s where you spend the most money.”",2017-08-23,1530453,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-23-at-8-36-40-am.png?w=738,enterprise/,"health-care,benefits,lumity",Lumity raises $19M to simplify employee health care choices,zenefits,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/lumity-raises-19m-to-simplify-employee-health-care-choices/

Co-founded by four Stanford PhD’s who had done on other groundbreaking work in networking technologies, including pioneering efforts in software-defined networking (SDN), Forward Networks will use the funding to hire more engineers and expand its product features, said David Erickson, one of those four co-founders who is also the startup’s CEO (the other three co-founders are Nikhil Handigol, Brandon Heller and Peyman Kazemian).
Its latest release, as it happens, is also being launched today in beta: Forward Essentials, a freemium product that lets network operators quickly access network state (the first step in identifying and repairing faults). It’s also adding support for VMware vSphere virtual networking on ESXi hosts to its list of supported networks.
This Series B round was led by DFJ, with participation from previous investors Andreessen Horowitz and A.Capital Ventures (the early stage fund that Ronny Conway left A16Z to create).
Many of us remember the days of Twitter that were punctuated by the “fail whale” whenever the network went down. Today, Twitter’s network is a lot more robust, but that issue underscores a persistent problem in the digital world: network outages happen, and the reasons why are growing by the day.
“David and his team have built a truly game-changing platform” said Andreas Stavropoulos, partner at DFJ, in a statement. “Modern enterprise networks are larger, more diverse and more fragile than ever before. Forward has taken a critical and significant step forward in how organizations manage their networks.”
At the same time, our reliance on networks continuing to stay up has grown massively: in business environments we need networks to be up to do any work at all, and in more consumer environments, we now use digital networks to run services in our house, to communicate and more.
The issue is that within the networking industry, most of products used to maintain networks are decades old and out of date.
“In the last 20 years, the rate of complexity in network size, the number of protocols, the vendors [whose kit is in the network], and how all of those layer have all been increasing at nearly an exponential rate,” noted Erickson in an interview. “But the dollars into the operations space to continue to manage these has been nearly nonexistent. There has been a big pinch.”
A lot of the responsibility for having everything work smoothly and avoiding outages falls to network operations teams, who take in tickets and issue fixes. They often use their own tools and legacy services like traceroutes to identify where traffic is going and where it’s coming from. But this process can be slow, and expensive, and not comprehensive enough. “The metric we use at Forward to figure out how effective we are is ‘how much time and money can we save everyone in the operations and security teams in their jobs?” Erickson said. “How many outages have there been and can we reduce the mean time to repair, or prevent them altogether?”
The idea behind what Forward Networks does is reminiscent of the application of big data that we are seeing in other parts of the tech world, this time applied specifically to networks: it identifies the myriad protocols, nodes, and systems that have been woven together in one complex network; it then creates maps of those networks, and builds behavioral models for how they work.
“We then automate a huge amount of the work that goes into information collection and analysis, using mathematical algorithms that we built while still at Stanford,” Erickson said.
As you would expect, the company is not able to reveal a full list of its customers, but it notes a couple of biggies that point to what kinds of businesses are using it: DXC, the HP Enterprise and CSC merged IT services leviathan; and Telstra, the Australian incumbent telco.
Forward Networks is working in a fairly new area of the networking world — Erickson acknowledged to me when I asked about it that it can be a hard sell to some companies as a result, since it’s presenting a new product and solution that network operators have essentially been making do without for decades at this point.
But nonetheless, it’s an important area, and as a mark of how it may be heating up, there is another startup emerging that is a close competitor. Veriflow, also founded by university networking PhD’s, last year also announced its own raise of $11 million from an equally impressive set of backers: Menlo Ventures and NEA.
Still, the investors in Forward believe that they’re betting on a strong horse, and that the field in any case is still wide open, with large enterprises, on average, experiencing at least five outages per month at a cost of $740,000 for each outage, according to Bill Krause, who is a board partner at Andreessen Horowitz.
“We are very pleased to witness Forward Networks’ accomplishments. Three years ago we invested in the company because of the strength of the team, the differentiating technology, and the long-term vision of the company,” said Krause in a statment. “The company’s execution, vision and intense commitment to its customers is further proof that this was a smart investment.”
“I am delighted to be part of the continued success of Forward Networks”, said Ronny Conway, founder and general partner at A.Capital, in a statement. “We saw the company’s potential and believed in their vision at an early stage. I am excited to see the next phase of the company’s growth that this new round of funding will accelerate”.
Today’s Series B brings the total funding for Forward Networks to $27 million. The company is not disclosing its valuation with this round.",2017-08-23,1530254,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-140648180.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"networks,network-security,outages",Forward Networks nets $16M to help prevent network outages,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/forward-networks-nets-16m-to-help-prevent-network-outages/
John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"This afternoon Microsoft announced Brainwave, an FPGA-based system for ultra-low latency deep learning in the cloud. Early benchmarking indicates that when using Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs, Brainwave can sustain 39.5 Teraflops on a large gated recurrent unit without any batching.
Microsoft has been pouring resources into FPGAs for a while now, deploying large clusters of the field-programmable gate arrays into its data centers. Algorithms are written into FPGAs, making them quite efficient and easily reprogrammable. This specialization makes them ideal for machine learning, specifically parallel computing.
Building on this work, Microsoft has synthesized DPU or DNN processing units into its FPGAs. The hope is that by focusing on deep neural nets, Microsoft can adapt its infrastructure faster to keep up with research and offer near real-time processing.

For as retro of a technology as FPGAs are, the nifty chips have been having something of a renaissance in recent years. Mipsology, an FPGA-obsessed startup, has been working closely with Amazon to make the technology accessible over Amazon Web Services and other platforms.
If the last few decades were about creating generalized CPUs to handle a broad array of processes, the last few months have been about building custom chips that excel at specific tasks. A solid chunk of these efforts have gone toward dedicated chips for machine learning.
The most notable effort by far has been Google’s Tensor Processing Unit. The chips are optimized around TensorFlow, and early benchmarking completed has been very promising. That said, most major tech companies have side projects around the future of computing — quantum chips, FPGAs, etc. And when there’s interest from tech giants, startups are willing to make a game of it — Rigetti, Mythic and Wave to name a few.
No word on when Brainwave will be available for Microsoft Azure customers. As of now the system works with Google’s popular TensorFlow and Microsoft’s own CNTK. The company is setting ambitious expectations for deep learning performance using the technology, so there will undoubtedly be plenty more benchmarking news in the coming months.",2017-08-22,1529847,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-513711216.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"technology,computing",Microsoft Brainwave aims to accelerate deep learning with FPGAs,"intel,microsoft",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/microsoft-brainwave-aims-to-accelerate-deep-learning-with-fpgas/
Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Earlier this year it looked as though Salesforce was starting to position itself as a company that would hit $10 billion in annual revenue run rate later this year — and, if all seems well, it looks like it may hit that target.
Salesforce reported its second-quarter earnings today, saying it brought in $2.56 billion in revenue on earnings of 33 cents per share. This is a beat on both fronts, but the stock dipped slightly in extended trading after seeing a rather stunning run-up over the course of the year. Since January, shares of Salesforce have risen almost 36 percent despite dropping around 3 percent after the report came out today.
While Salesforce may be on track to generate $10 billion in revenue, a lot of eyes are on the back half of the year for its annual Dreamforce conference. That’s when Salesforce is expected to announce and unveil some new products, and there will likely especially be scrutiny on its so-called “Einstein” AI products. While Salesforce birthed tools for online customer relationship management, it faces the ever-present threat of smaller companies picking off niches and turning them into big companies.
Salesforce is going to modernize its products as it goes forward, including giving companies ways to reduce workload algorithmically as machine learning starts to bleed into enterprise software. The company has been pitching that line so hard and has gone so far as to state that it’s possible to spin up customer service tools in less than a day. Salesforce is going to likely have to continue pushing this story going forward.
There are certainly a lot of opportunities here, as Salesforce has started to make a push by opening up some tools to developers. So there are going to be a lot of expectations baked into the back half of the year toward that conference as Wall Street looks to the company to unveil a new wave of products that can automate routine tasks on its services.
Wall Street was looking for earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $2.51 billion.",2017-08-22,1529862,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-612902270.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"finance,earnings",Salesforce slides past its $10B annual run rate target,salesforce,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/salesforce-slides-past-its-10b-annual-run-rate-target/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Google is launching a new enterprise service for large businesses that want to adopt Chrome OS devices. The new Chrome Enterprise subscription, which will cost $50 per device and year, is essentially a rebrand of Chrome Device Management, but with a number of additional capabilities. Even though the name would make you think this is about the Chrome browser, this program is actually all about Chrome OS. For Chrome users in the enterprise, Google already offers the Chrome Enterprise Bundle for IT, after all.
For enterprises, the main highlight here is that Chrome Enterprise is fully compatible with their existing on-premise Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure. Google senior director of product management for Android and Chrome for Business and Education Rajen Sheth told me that this has long been a stumbling block for many enterprises that were looking at adopting Chrome OS devices. With this update, enterprise users will be able to use their existing credentials to log into their Chrome OS devices and access their Google Cloud services — and IT admins will be able to manage their access to these devices and services.
It’s worth noting that Chrome OS admins could already enable other services that use the SAML standard to enable single sign-on for Chrome devices.
In addition, businesses also will now be able to manage their Chrome OS devices from the same enterprise mobility management solutions they already use, starting with VMware’s AirWatch. Support for similar services will launch in the future.
With this new licence, IT admins also will be able to set up a managed enterprise app store for their users. This feature is currently in beta and focuses on Chrome OS’s ability to run Android apps, which is currently available on many of the most popular Chrome devices in the enterprise.
Other benefits of the Chrome Enterprise subscription include 24/7 enterprise support, managed OS updates and printer management (you may laugh about this last one, but that’s something that still matters in many offices).
It’s no secret that Google is working hard to get more enterprises to adopt its various cloud-based services. Chromebooks have already found a lucrative niche in verticals like retail and education. To expand its market share, though, features like this new integration with AirWatch were sorely needed.",2017-08-22,1529646,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/dscf2296.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"enterprise,chrome",Google launches Chrome Enterprise subscription service for Chrome OS,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/google-launches-chrome-enterprise-for-businesses-that-want-to-use-chrome-os/
