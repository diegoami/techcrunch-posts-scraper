Ingrid Lunden,Collaborative Consumption,"As outsized ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft continue to build out their taxi-style marketplaces largely based around connecting individual passengers to individual drivers, a startup focused squarely on the carpooling opportunity has raised a large round of funding to expand outside of the U.S.
Via — which has developed a shuttle-based carpooling service that it offers directly in the U.S. for a flat-rate starting at $5, as well as through platform partnerships with other transportation providers — has raised what it is describing as a “strategic investment” led by German automaker Daimler to expand into Europe as well as to work more closely on other business opportunities together. Alongside this, Daimler’s Mercedes Benz division is investing $50 million into a joint venture with the startup. The full amount of funding has not been disclosed, but we understand from a source very close to the deal that it is $250 million.
The sizeable funding underscores ongoing momentum in the transportation industry to build more tech-based solutions, updating outmoded legacy infrastructure with more efficient services that can meet the new demand for on-demand. Services like Uber’s — even amidst all of the controversy around its work culture and upheaval in its executive leadership — have been gaining ground as an alternative to car ownership, but they are also eating into the business of mass-transit services. 
While carpooling — where people come together in small groups to ride in the same general direction in a single car — is something that the Ubers of the world are also offering, it also presents a window of opportunity to those mass transit companies to better compete against transportation-on-demand services, and fill a hole to serve consumers who might be weighing up alternatives.
“What you’ve seen in the last few years is that the solution for on-demand shuttles has gained a lot of momentum,” CTO and co-founder Oren Shoval (who co-founded the company with Daniel Ramot) told TechCrunch in an interview. “A lot of local stakeholders have licensed our platform.” The company is also embarking on a big recruitment drive with this round. 
Other investors are not being revealed at this stage — Daimler is having a signing ceremony today to commemorate its specific involvement — but backers in this round include some of the company’s previous investors. Before this round, Via had raised $137 million with investors including 83North, C4 Ventures, Ervington Investments, Expansion Venture Capital, Hearst Ventures, Kapor Capital, Lior Prosor, Pitango, Planven, Poalim and RiverPark. Pitango had led Via’s previous two rounds, a $100 million Series C and a $27 million Series B.
The valuation is also not being disclosed, but a source tells us that it is a ‘definite upround.’ According to market analytics firm Zirra, the pre-money valuation for Via was between $450 million and $500 million. Based on that, at a rough estimate, that would put the valuation for Via now at $750 million.
Shoval said that the investment will see Via expanding its own-branded operations in Europe, initially in London, with Paris soon to follow. Via is also going to come to more markets in the U.S.: today, it’s live in New York, Chicago, and Washington DC and says it’s providing over 1 million rides per month, but it has also run smaller programs in Austin, TX and Orange County, CA, so those regions could be two likely targets for further expansion.
What’s interesting about Via is that while it is building its direct to consumer, own-brand operations, it also has been inking licensing deals with third parties that are already established in various places. These include partnerships with Arriva and Keolis, two mass-transit companies that operate city buses, train services and more in multiple counties. (Arriva is part of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Keolis’ parent is SNCF of France.)
Arriva and Keolis are licensing Via’s operating system to build their own carpooling trials. “This is an example how we use our tech to let companies transition to dynamic, real time solutions,” said Shoval. “It’s much more efficient to offer dynamic solutions using smaller vehicles instead of large busses.” He added that there is also potential to use Via’s platform to help direct traffic for other vehicles they operate.
Shoval said that the Daimler deal getting announced today will encompass investments and partnerships to expand these two existing business lines, and more.
Via has been in partnership with Daimler for years already, including working on the pilot in Orange County using Mercedez Benz vehicles. 
This Via investment presents a number of opportunities to Daimler. One is that it gives Daimler a bigger sales funnel in providing vehicles for such services. In particular, a Via partnership can help in their own R&D and design work for new vehicles optimised for carpooling and other on-demand transportation. “One big question [for the future of transportation] is, ‘what is the right vehicle?'” Shoval said. “There are the seating arrangements, how you connect the sensors, what kind of door it should have. This is a big piece of mobility.”
It will also give Daimler an opportunity to embed technology and sensors in those vehicles that can make other ridesharing services more efficient. “We also believe that the vehicles in the network, at the end of the day, it’s not just an app but a whole service that you are getting. It makes sense to have these things converge,” said Shoval. 
Lastly, it gives Daimler a chance to get behind the wheel (so to speak) of the transportation service itself, thus developing a business around recurring service revenues.
Daimler is no stranger to the ridesharing business, or indeed in investing around transportation. Similar to other automakers like Volkswagen and GM, the company has made a number of investments and acquisitions in the last several years around transportation technology and also transportation services themselves. They include an owning stake in Here, the mapping business; investments in Careem and car-tech services like Momenta; and the acquisition of myTaxi and the many operations that now form a part of that like Hailo and TaxiBeat.
“On-demand ride-sharing offers many new ways of making city traffic efficient, needs-based and sustainable – especially when it involves the use of spacious, safe and comfortable vans,” says Volker Mornhinweg, Head of Mercedes-Benz Vans, in a statement. “Via is one of the most successful providers in the growing ride-sharing sector while Mercedes-Benz Vans has the perfect vehicles that are being continuously optimized for this job. By deepening our cooperation with Via, we are thus taking the next logical step in the context of our strategy for the future and are expanding our range of new mobility services.”",2017-09-04,1535669,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/via-product-shot-2017.jpg?w=738,europe/,"transportation,carpooling,via,daimler",Via raises $250M led by Daimler to bring its carpooling technology to Europe,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/via-raises-250m-led-by-daimler-to-bring-its-carpooling-technology-to-europe/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Habito, a London startup that is bringing the entire mortgage process online, has raised £18.5 million in Series B funding. Atomico, the European VC firm founded by Skype’s Niklas Zennström, led the round, with participation from existing investors Ribbit Capital, Mosaic Ventures, and Revolutionary (Ad)Ventures. It brings the total raised by the U.K. company to just over £27 million.
More interestingly, Habito, which probably counts Trussle as its closest direct competitor, says the new capital will in part be used to integrate its technology with major retail banks and high street lenders to facilitate “real-time mortgage approvals”, in addition to marketing and other product development. The startup says it also plans to expand its offering to other parts of the mortgage process, namely home and life insurance.
Calling itself a “digital mortgage broker,” Habito was founded by Daniel Hegarty, who was previously an early employee at Wonga, to remove a lot of the friction when applying for a mortgage. The company’s tech claims to analyse over 11,000 mortgage products across 70
lenders in real-time, to help identify the most suitable mortgage based on your individual circumstances. The entire application process can then be completed via the Habito app/website for free, thus eliminating the fees that most traditional mortgage brokers charge.
There is, however, an additional aspect to the Habito premise, and one that has the potential to be quite disruptive beyond pricing. Once you’ve signed up to the app and entered all of the required details related to your eligibility and your current mortgage and property (if you have one), the startup will effectively become your broker going forward.
This sees its tech continually monitor the mortgage products available on the market and alert you if it thinks you have become mismatched and therefore are paying over the odds. The idea is to make switching also as frictionless as possible. That’s because, says Habito, 1 in 4 British homeowners are currently mismatched, paying lenders an average of around £4,000 more than they need to every year.
“Fintech companies are tackling a lot of traditional areas that are ready for a new approach. This is one of them,” Atomico Partner Niall Wass tells TechCrunch. “Matching borrowers and lenders in the residential mortgage space is slow, expensive and very fragmented – with around 15,000 largely offline brokers in the U.K. But the potential is not just in the U.K., it’s across multiple markets with the same problem.”
However, despite describing the Habito value proposition for both borrowers and lenders as being pretty clear, Wass says one challenge the startup faces is the degree of apathy by house owners when it comes to remortgaging.
“This apathy is why there is such massive overspend in this market globally – perhaps because the process to move to a better mortgage has been so slow and complicated. So the first challenge is continuing to make the process simple, speedy, free and with a better outcome for the borrower. This is absolutely key,” he says.
“I love the idea that Habito has your back and will check the market automatically for a better deal for you – but that kind of message has to get out, so the next challenge is to help build the brand”.
In addition, the Atomico VC says that Habito will need to further prove the benefits to lenders too by using more technology to make it easier and cheaper to “assess the customer risk and matching them to the most appropriate product”. Hence plans to integrate with major retail banks and high street lenders at the technology level.",2017-09-03,1535517,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/habito-press-image-2.jpg?w=738,europe/,"atomico,trussle","Habito, an app that helps you find the right mortgage, raises £18.5M Series B led by Atomico",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/03/habito-atomico/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"De-cloaking today is a new startup from two of the founders of defunct food delivery company Take Eat Easy. Dubbed Cowboy, the company is building a new electronic bicycle that it claims will address issues that have historically stopped e-bikes from becoming a “fully fledged mobility solution”.
“We haven’t launched yet,” Cowboy co-founder Adrien Roose tells me. “We are still entirely focusing on product development. After six months of design, engineering and industrialisation, we now have a first fully functional prototype. We will keep iterating on the product in the coming months, with the objective to launch early Spring 2018”.
Specifically, the Cowboy bike aims to better previous e-bikes in terms of pricing, product design, and technology — with the broader mission to “improve urban mobility by increasing the popularity of electric bikes”.
Key features include what Roose says is an intuitive and automatic motor assistance, a removable semi-integrated “smart battery,” and an app to turn the bike on and off and support theft detection, including GPS tracking. In addition, Cowboy plans to offer remote troubleshooting and software updates.
The distribution model of Cowboy is a classic online play, too. The startup says it will sell the e-bike through direct channels, allowing for “disintermediated” pricing of €1,399.
“As a digital native vertical brand, we’ve developed our own technology, allowing us to control both product design and production cost. To develop a connection with our customers, and lower prices, we will only distribute our product through direct sales channel,” adds Roose.
Cowboy’s other founders are Karim Slaoui, who along with Roose previously co-founded Brussels and London-based Take East Easy, an early Deliveroo competitor, and Tanguy Goretti, who was previously co-founder and CEO of Djump, an early competitor to Uber Pop in Europe.",2017-08-31,1533510,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cowboybike-21.jpg?w=738,europe/,,Cowboy is a new e-bike startup from founders of Take Eat Easy,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/cowboy-bike/
Natasha Lomas,Artificial Intelligence,"A wide-ranging, UK government-commissioned industrial strategy review of the life sciences sector, conducted by Oxford University’s Sir John Bell, has underlined the value locked up in publicly funded data held by the country’s National Health Service — and called for a new regulatory framework to be established in order to “capture for the UK the value in algorithms generated using NHS data”.
The NHS is a free-at-the-point of use national health service covering some 65 million users — which gives you an idea of the unique depth and granularity of the patient data it holds.
And how much potential value could therefore be created for the nation by utilizing patient data-sets to develop machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and tracking.
“AI is likely to be used widely in healthcare and it should be the ambition for the UK to develop and test integrated AI systems that provide real-time data better than human monitoring and prediction of a wide range of patient outcomes in conditions such as mental health, cancer and inflammatory disease,” writes Bell in the report.
His recommendation for the government and the NHS to be pro-active about creating and capturing AI-enabled value off of valuable, taxpayer-funded health data-sets comes hard on the heels of the conclusion of a lengthy investigation by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, into a controversial 2015 data-sharing arrangement between Google-DeepMind and a London-based NHS Trust, the Royal Free Hospitals Trust, to co-develop a clinical task management app.
In July the ICO concluded that the arrangement — DeepMind’s first with an NHS Trust — breached UK privacy law, saying the ~1.6M NHS patients whose full medical records are being shared with the Google-owned company (without their consent) could not have “reasonably expected” their information to be used in this way.
And while the initial application the pair have co-developed does not involve applying machine learning algorithms to NHS data, a wider memorandum of understanding between them sets out their intention to do just that within five years.
Meanwhile, DeepMind has also inked additional data-sharing arrangements with other NHS Trusts that do already entail AI-based research — such as a July 2016 research partnership with Moorfields Eye Hospital that’s aiming to investigate whether machine learning algorithms can automate the analysis of digital eye scans to diagnose two eye conditions.
In that instance DeepMind is getting free access to one million “anonymized” eye scans to try to develop diagnosis AI models.
The company has committed to publishing the results of the research but any AI models it develops — trained off of the NHS data-set — are unlikely to be handed back freely to the public sector.
Rather, the company’s stated aim for its health-based AI ambitions is to create commercial IP, via multiple research partnerships with NHS organizations — positioning itself to sell trained AI models as a future software-based service to healthcare organizations at whatever price it deems appropriate.
This is exactly the sort of data-enabled algorithmic value that Bell is urging the UK government to be pro-active about capturing for the country — by establishing a regulatory framework that positions the NHS (and the UK’s citizens who fund it) to benefit from data-based AI insights generated off of its vast data holdings, instead of allowing large commercial entities to push in and asset strip these taxpayer-funded assets.
“[E]xisting data access agreements in the UK for algorithm development have currently been completed at a local level with mainly large companies and may not share the rewards fairly, given the essential nature of NHS patient data to developing algorithms,” warns Bell.
“There is an opportunity for defining a clear framework to better realise the true value for the NHS of the data at a national level, as currently agreements made locally may not share the benefit with other regions,” he adds.
In an interview with the Guardian newspaper he is asked directly for his views on DeepMind’s collaboration with the Royal Free NHS Trust — and describes it as the “canary in the coalmine”.
“I heard that story and thought ‘Hang on a minute, who’s going to profit from that?’” he is quoted as saying. “What Google’s doing in [other sectors], we’ve got an equivalent unique position in the health space. Most of the value is the data. The worst thing we could do is give it away for free.”
“What you don’t want is somebody rocking up and using NHS data as a learning set for the generation of algorithms and then moving the algorithm to San Francisco and selling it so all the profits come back to another jurisdiction,” Bell also told the newspaper.
In his report, Bell also highlights the unpreparedness of “current or planned” regulations to provide a framework to “account for machine learning algorithms that update with new data” — pointing out, for example, that: “Currently algorithms making medical claims are regulated as medical devices.”
And again, in 2016 DeepMind suspended testing of the Streams app it had co-developed with the Royal Free NHS Trust after it emerged the pair had failed to register this software as a medical device with the MHRA prior to trialling it in the hospitals.
Bell suggests that a better approach for testing healthcare software and algorithms could involve sandboxed access and use of dummy data — rather than testing with live patient data, as DeepMind and the Royal Free were.
“One approach to this may be in the development of ‘sandbox’ access to deidentified or synthetic data from providers such as NHS Digital, where innovators could safely develop algorithms and trial new regulatory approaches for all product types,” he writes.
In the report Bell also emphasizes the importance of transparency in winning public trust to further the progress of research which utilizes publicly funded health data-sets.
“Many more people support than oppose health data being used by commercial organisations undertaking health research, but it is also clear that strong patient and clinician engagement and involvement, alongside clear permissions and controls, are vital to the success of any health data initiative,” he writes.
“This should take place as part of a wider national conversation with the public enabling a true understanding of data usage in as much detail as they wish, including clear information on who can access data and for what purposes. This conversation should also provide full information on how health data is vital to improving health, care and services through research.”
He also calls for the UK’s health care system to “set out clear and consistent national approaches to data and interoperability standards and requirements for data access agreements” in order to help reduce response time across all data providers, writing: “Currently, arranging linkage and access to national-level datasets used for research can require multiple applications and access agreements with unclear timelines. This can cause delays to data access enabling both research and direct care.”
Other NHS-related recommendations in the report include a call to end handwritten prescriptions and make eprescribing mandatory for hospitals; the creation of a forum for researchers across academia, charities and industry to engage with all national health data programs; and the creation of between two and five digital innovation hubs to provide data across regions of three to five million people with the aim of accelerating research access to meaningful national datasets.",2017-08-31,1534283,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/shutterstock_159747701.jpg?w=738,europe/,"machine-learning,united-kingdom,national-health-service,health-care","Building health AIs should be UK ambition, says strategy review",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/building-health-ais-should-be-uk-ambition-says-strategy-review/
Natasha Lomas,Artificial Intelligence,"Libratone, a Danish maker of snazzy high end wireless speakers, has announced its existing Zipp and Zipp Mini speakers will get support for Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant via a free app update, slated to arrive this fall.
This means existing owners of the speakers will be able to jump aboard the smart speaker craze — and use their Libratone Zipps like an Amazon Echo and ask Alexa to do stuff like look up sports scores, tell a joke, provide a weather update or indeed order something from Amazon.com.
Although — unlike Amazon’s Echo speakers — the Libratone Zipps do not have built-in microphones that are persistently listening for a trigger word.
The company confirmed that users wanting to talk to Alexa will therefore have to manually touch a button on the top of the speaker to do so. So while the quality of Libratone’s audio is more premium than Amazon’s Echo speaker hardware, its existing microphones (previously used to support a conference call functionality) aren’t as tuned for this use-case — ergo there will be more friction between you and Alexa’s ‘lazy web’ answers to your voice commands.
(Or more privacy safeguards between you and Amazon’s data-harvesting AI, depending on your perspective.)
Rival speaker maker Sonos had already been expected to unveil its own voice play on October 4. And according to an FCC filing, Sonos intends to introduce support for multiple voice assistants to existing speaker hardware.
But Libratone’s opening gambit here is to start with just Amazon’s Alexa as its chosen partner for ‘smartifying’ its premium hardware.
Asked why it’s adding Alexa Libratone’s president, Mike Culver, told TechCrunch it had noticed some customers already using their Zipps with Amazon’s entry level Echo Dot device — so seeking to control their Zipp via Alexa voice commands sent to the ever-listening Dot.
“We started investigating additional integrations that would make sense based on the consumer demand — for the Amazon Alexa capabilities, but available in a much better quality sounding speaker, which is why they’re purchasing Zipp and Zipp Mini and pairing it with the Echo Dot,” he said. “That was the stimulus.”
“Then when we looked at the bigger picture we fundamentally believe that one of the key interfaces, from a usability standpoint for our speakers, should evolve to include voice. It’s a natural way to interact with our speakers and with music. And we believe the speaker also serves as a natural integration point to the smart home.
“So both of these led us to integrate with Amazon,” he added.
What happens if a customer does not want their speaker to be turned into an Amazon-enabled listening outpost? Culver said that while the user does not have a choice to decline the firmware update, they would need to take additional steps to actually enable and activate Alexa. And thus could choose not to.
“After the Libratone Zipp or Zipp Mini speaker have the firmware update for Amazon Voice Services, the user will need to use the Libratone App to enable and configure it,” he confirmed. “The Libratone App will include a step that will take you to the Alexa App (and require you to download it if you do not already have it), where you will register the Zipp/Mini speaker for use with Amazon Voice Services.  Afterward, you will be passed back to the Libratone App for final confirmation.” 
Culver also noted that as part of the Alexa App registration a user would have to accept Amazon’s privacy policy, since they will be using Amazon’s voice services. Though, again, Zipp owners not wanting to agree to their personal data being processed by the ecommerce giant can do so by avoiding registering for the Alexa app.
“All of our updates require the customer to authorize the update to the speaker… And once they update — and we’re always doing updates so eventually all the speakers will have this capability — they still have to configure it for it to start working,” added Culver, further emphasizing that even users who do configure Alexa still have to manually touch a button on the top of the speaker and say the word “Alexa” to summon the AI.
Therefore, he said, Libratone will not be updating its own privacy policy ahead of this impending update as it does not believe it needs to.
“That’s the difference between farfield microphones, that are just continuously listening, vs the way we’ve implemented it — which is based on the use-case that the customer has to intentionally want to do this. They have to touch the bird [logo on the button on top of the speaker] and at the same time give the Alexa voice command,” he added.
“We are planning to add the possibility to disable [the Alexa integration] from within the Libratone App if customers wish to do so,” he also noted.
Culver would not comment on whether Libratone is planning to launch any new speaker models in future with the Alexa AI baked in from the get-go plus microphone hardware that is always listening.
“This is what we think is a really good first step,” he added. “And we’re always studying voice as a user interface — and I think all the questions that you’re asking are the same ones that we’re continually asking ourselves… so we’ll see how this [space] evolves both in implementation as well as with other competing voice services in the future.”
In another integration twist, Amazon and Microsoft yesterday announced a forthcoming tie-up will enable users of Alexa to summon Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant, and vice versa. So, in future, it may end up that enabling one voice assistant means being able to get in touch with any of them — at least, that’s Jeff Bezos’ prediction.
In the meanwhile, Libratone owners enabling the Alexa integration can certainly look forward to being able to ask the AI to summon Cortana too — if they really want to use their speaker to update their calendar or check something in Outlook.
For now it looks like the immediate future of voice interfaces will be voice assistants nested within voice assistants — in an attempt to make the technology more useful. Let’s just hope all these various vocal summons don’t result in cacophonous confusion of AI assistance.
What’s the collective noun for a group of voice AIs? With ‘echo’ already taken directly, we’ll have to pencil in ‘nest’ (sorry, Google!) as the working word for that.",2017-08-31,1534120,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/libratone-black-06-closeup-2-hr.jpg?w=738,europe/,"zipp,amazon-com,libratone,smart-speakers",Libratone update will add Amazon Alexa voice control to its speakers,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/libratone-update-will-add-alexa-voice-control-to-its-speakers/
Natasha Lomas,eCommerce,"Google has submitted details to the European Commission of how it intends to amend its price comparison service, Google Shopping, to comply with an antitrust decision earlier this summer. The proposals were submitted yesterday.
A spokesperson for the Commission confirmed it had received information from Google pertaining to complying with the ruling.
The company has until the end of September to end its censured conduct or risk a regime of additional daily fines that would be backdated to the date of non-compliance.
The Commission has not published Google’s proposals for complying with the ruling — and TechCrunch understands there is no official intention to make the proposals public.
“It is Google’s sole responsibility to ensure compliance with the Commission antitrust decision. The Commission’s role is to monitor Google’s compliance. In this context the Commission can confirm that, as required by the Commission decision, it has received information from Google on how the company intends to ensure compliance with the Commission decision by the set deadline. Furthermore, Google will continue to be under an obligation to keep the Commission informed of its actions by submitting periodic reports,” the EC spokesperson told us.
“The Commission decision requires Google to stop its illegal conduct within 90 days of the decision and refrain from any measure that has the same or an equivalent object or effect. In particular, the Commission decision sets out the principle that Google has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and its own service.”
Back in June Europe’s Competition Commission issued Google with a record-breaking €2.42 billion (~$2.73BN) fine for antitrust violations pertaining to Google Shopping.
Its finding was that Google had demoted rival comparison search services in organic search results, while at the same time as giving systematically prominent placement to its own comparison shopping services.
The fine was the culmination of more than six years of investigation by the European Commission into Google’s search practices — although a formal Statement of Objections was not issued until April 2015.
The company’s search engine holds a hugely dominant marketshare of the European market (circa 90 per cent) — and the Commission additionally deemed Google to be a dominant company in Internet search; a finding which will feed into additional EU antitrust investigations into its behavior.
Google was given 90 days to cease the censured conduct pertaining to Google Shopping or face additional penalty payments of up to 5 per cent of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, its parent company, for each day of non-compliance.
And while Google initially suggested it might be considering an appeal, it appears the company has decided compliance is the safer option.
A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment when reached for comment but confirmed it has informed the Commission of its planned remedies to comply with their decision.
ICOMP, an ecommerce lobby group formed of Google rivals, has called for the publication of both Google’s proposed remedy and the full Commission decision — which has yet to be put online, although competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in June it would publish the decision in full (minus any commercially necessary redactions).
In a statement yesterday, ICOMP’s chairman Michael Weber said: “ICOMP calls for publication of the full commission decision and Google’s remedy proposals so that we and the public generally can compare the proposals (if any) with the Commission’s assessment of Google’s wrongdoing. These affect everyone in the online and mobile worlds, so they must be made public for evaluation.”
The EC has additional ongoing antitrust investigations into other areas of Google’s business, including its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising-related practices.
In June, Vestager said the EC’s preliminary conclusions in relation to both practices is that they also breach EU antitrust rules — though she also emphasized the investigations remain ongoing.",2017-08-30,1533459,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/524861120.jpg?w=738,europe/,"european-commission,shopping,online-advertising",Google takes steps to comply with EC antitrust order for Google Shopping,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/google-takes-steps-to-comply-with-ec-antitrust-order-for-google-shopping/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"There seems to be no end to the number of startups operating in the travel and accommodation space. These range from online travel agencies, hotel booking sites and aggregators, to companies that help hotels fight back in an attempt to get more direct bookings. And of course there is Airbnb and its ilk.
One growing sector we can add to the travel accommodation list is long term stays for business travelers. Enter Cologne-based Homelike, founded in 2015 by Dustin Figge and Christoph Kasper. The German startup targets business travelers who need “long-stay” accommodation of a month or more and for which a hotel doesn’t really cut it. Citing growing demand from both the supply and demand side, the startup has just raised €4 million in Series A funding led by Cherry Ventures, with participation from existing backer Coparion.
“Due to many international work assignments, Christoph and I used to work and live abroad for several months with stays in China, the U.S, and some European cities. Eventually we were both tired of staying in hotels with limited privacy and without a ‘home away from home’ feeling,” explains Figge, Homelike’s CEO.
“Furnished apartments were more comfortable, flexible and also significantly cheaper than hotel rooms. We both liked it way more than hotels! However, it was anything but easy to find a suitable apartment and book it online from a remote location. That was the point, the idea for Homelike, and thus our business was born”.
As the pair began to scope out the startup’s product, Figge says it became more evident how underserved business travel is within the apartment rental market. At the same time, companies increasingly require employees to relocate temporarily as part of their work for weeks if not months on end.
“Also companies themselves are trying to cut accommodation costs rapidly these days,” he adds. “They spend about 25 per cent of their business travel costs on overnight stays. When it comes to prolonged periods, furnished apartments are, in most cases, a 40 per cent more cost-effective solution in comparison to hotels. Including added benefits of being more comfortable and flexible. Simultaneously, the temporary housing market is growing rapidly by 20 per cent year over year and is becoming much more professional”.
To take advantage — and feed — this trend, Homelike offers an entirely online and “no friction” booking experience for furnished apartments for long stays. This includes a secure booking process, corporate travel policies (such as VAT invoicing), and a user experience it says is designed to cater to the needs of corporates.
Furthermore, Figge says that apartment providers prefer Homelike because they can easily list their entire inventory online. “After the apartments have been verified based on our quality standards, the landlord can relax knowing that we take care of the whole process end-to-end, including the billing and transactional process. We are the only platform which provides a digital rental agreement that is signed by both parties, skipping the traditional process of printing and sending a paper copy back and forth,” he explains.
More broadly — and something that likely attracted Cherry — is that the rental market is generally shifting towards the direction of furnished and serviced living. “Similar to the shifts we are experiencing in transport and mobility, we believe that the rental market will develop towards a ‘living-as-a-service model’,” says Figge.

Darrell Etherington,Asia,"Another major automaker is setting up a dedicated joint venture to build EVs for the growing demand in China, joining Ford and Volkswagen: This time, it’s Nissan-Renault, which will work with China’s Dongfeng Motor, an automaker it partnered with last year to open its first factory in China.
Automakers from outside China basically need a local dancing partner in order to make and sell vehicles in the country, without incurring huge import taxes that would basically render their operations unsustainable. Previously, automakers were limited to setting up two joint ventures with Chinese partners to produce cars in-country, but Beijing has allowed the creation of a third joint venture – provided it’s dedicated entirely to EVs.
Renault-Nissan’s new partnership with Dongfeng is called eGT New Energy Automotive Company, and it’ll be split between Nissan with 25 percent ownership, Renault with another 25, and Dongfeng with the remaining 50, according to Reuters. The first vehicle from the JV will be a new electric vehicle based on one of Renault-Nissan’s subcompact crossover SUV platform designs.
Automakers are racing to build out their EV construction and sales capacity in China thanks to strong incentives put in place by the Chinese government for the market. China is also enforcing strict quotas on overall vehicle sales, requiring that a full 8 percent of any automaker sales in the country be either pure electric or plug-in hybrid by 2018, with incremental increases in that percentage every year after that.
This could end up helping with electrification abroad, too, since it’ll help automakers reconfigure their operations to focus on developing EV tech and electric-specific vehicle designs.",2017-08-29,1532881,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-508080342.jpg?w=738,asia/,"dongfeng-motor,renault-nissan",Renault-Nissan and Dongfeng partner to build electric cars for China,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/renault-nissan-and-dongfeng-partner-to-build-electric-cars-for-china/
Catherine Shu,Asia,"China’s crackdown on Internet freedom is getting even more intense. Last Friday, the country’s top Internet censor announced a new set of regulations (link via Google Translate) meant to eliminate posts by anonymous users on Internet forums and other platforms. The Cyberspace Administration of China will start enforcing those rules on Oct. 1.
According to the new regulations, Internet companies and service providers are responsible for requesting and verifying real names from users when they register and must immediately report illegal content to the authorities. Tech firms, including Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, are under more pressure to serve as the government’s gatekeepers as China prepares for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party this fall, which is expected to place new people in several key leadership positions.
Furthermore, a new cybersecurity law that went into effect at the beginning of June requires tech companies to store important data on servers within China. While this is supposedly meant to protect sensitive information, it can also make it easier for the government to track and persecute Internet users.
Along with announcing its new regulations about anonymous posts on Friday, the CAC also specified what content is forbidden from being published online (link and translation via Google Translate), citing a passage from a bill that was passed in 2000 to regulate Internet information services in China. The list is so broad that it can cover almost anything:
While China has issued various rules requiring online real-name registration for years, the CAC’s new regulations are another sign that the government is becoming increasingly stringent about censorship. For example, using VPNs to access blocked sites like Facebook and Twitter was relatively easy until earlier this year when the government began a crackdown that many observers believe is much more serious than previous attempts to enforce the ban.
As The Diplomat notes, China is taking a multi-pronged approach as it doubles down on censorship, placing more pressure on international publishers as well.",2017-08-27,1532129,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-72054208.jpg?w=738,asia/,"real-name-registration,censorship,china","China doubles down on real-name registration laws, forbidding anonymous online posts",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/china-doubles-down-on-real-name-registration-laws-forbidding-anonymous-online-posts/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Go-Jek, the on-demand transportation company that rivals Uber and Grab in Indonesia, is getting close to pulling in its next huge funding round.
That’s because JD.com, the China-based e-commerce firm that rivals Alibaba, has agreed to join Go-Jek’s upcoming $1.2 billion round, a source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. The news was first reported by The Information.
We reported on the upcoming round, which would value Go-Jek at $3 billion post-money, in May when sources told us that Tencent had formally agreed to lead the deal. It looks like it has taken slightly longer to pull things together than was anticipated at the time, but the addition of JD.com — a long-term Tencent partner, which is reportedly putting $100 million in — it is close to being finalized.
Go-Jek previously raised $550 million at a $1.3 billion valuation in August 2016. It counts PE firms KKR and Warburg Pincus, and VCs Sequoia Capital, Northstar Group, DST Global and NSI Ventures among its backers.
Founded in 2010, Go-Jek began as a motorbike taxi on-demand service but it has since expanded to cover four wheels and offer services like grocery delivery, massages and more. The company most recently claimed to have over 200,000 drivers across some 25 cities in Indonesia, which remains the only market where it is active — although it does have a sizable development team located in India.
Go-Jek is also making a big push for its digital payment service, which it hopes can go beyond merely paying for rides and help build engagement and loyalty with customers to help it battle Uber and Grab. In that respect, the addition of Tencent — which has turned WeChat into a huge chat app with a strong mobile payment business, too — and JD.com could massively help.
Rival Grab, which recently raised $2 billion, is putting huge emphasis on Indonesia, where it is pushing its own digital payment service and making acquisitions to further it.
Aside from being Southeast Asia’s largest economy and population — Indonesia is home to over 250 million people — the country is tipped to be the region’s largest internet economy by some margin.
Southeast Asia’s ride-sharing market is predicted to grow from $2.5 billion in 2015 to $13 billion by 2025, according to a report co-authored by Google. Indonesia’s share of that segment is forecast to jump from an estimated $0.8 billion to $5.6 billion over that same period.",2017-08-25,1531461,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/go-jek.jpg?w=738,asia/,"economy,car-sharing,business,transport",Indonesian Uber rival Go-Jek closes in on new $1.2 billion round,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/go-jek-jd-com-tencent/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Samsung vice chairman and the company’s heir apparent Jay Y. Lee is headed to jail after a court in Korea ruled that he is guilty of bribery, embezzlement, capital flight and perjury charges.
Lee, who has been earmarked as the future leader of the company, was handed a five-year jail sentence, although he is expected to appeal the decision. He took a board seat at Samsung last year in a move that symbolized his ascension and the expectation that Lee would replace his father Lee Kun-Hee, who has been hospitalized for over two years since suffering a heart attack while at the helm of the corporation.
This verdict, which comes just days after Samsung launched its impressive new Galaxy Note 8 flagship phone, obviously throws Lee’s future at the company into question.
The executive was arrested in February when he was accused of paying bribes to an advisor of former President Park Geun-hye in exchange for political favors.
The New York Times reported that he is alleged to have given a total of $36 million to Park’s secret advisor in order to win government support for a merger between two Samsung subsidiaries. Park, Korea’s first female leader, was impeached and removed from office due to the influence of her aides.",2017-08-24,1531417,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/lee-jae-yong-samsung.jpg?w=738,asia/,"business,manufacturing",Samsung heir handed 5-year jail sentence for bribery,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/samsung-heir-handed-5-year-jail-sentence-for-bribery/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Grab is going all out to win the nascent ride-hailing market in Myanmar after it committed to investing $100 million into the Southeast Asian country over the next three years.
Myanmar might just be the world’s most fascinating internet market. Internet access had been heavily restricted when the country was fully controlled by the military, but it opened up following the free elections in 2015.
A huge adoption of mobile services followed as businesses, including operators and tech companies, flowed into the once reclusive country sensing an opportunity. Increased competition saw the cost of a SIM card, which was once $200 or upwards of $1,500 during military rule, drop to below $5 prompting the country’s 55 million population to move to mobile en masse.
Today, Myanmar has more registered SIM cards than people — a fact that was unthinkable just half a decade ago — and, with no real legacy fixed internet, the country has made a leap to mobile like no other place on earth.
E-commerce was an obvious first focus of Myanmar’s tech wave, and local takes on Uber popped up in recent years as smartphones became more widely owned. Earlier this year, the ride-sharing industry was shored up when Grab and Uber expanded into Myanmar, marking the seventh market in Southeast Asia for both services.
Now, Grab is claiming leadership — with 25,000 daily bookings and 6,000 drivers since its launch in March — and it has revealed an aggressive plan to cement its position.
As it has done in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, the Singapore-headquartered company has unveiled an investment package (at $100 million) to grow its business and move beyond transportation services. Doubtless its recent $2 billion funding has given the opportunity to initiate this program.
The initial focus early on centers around expanding the Grab service from capital city Yangon into other parts of the country, and increasing its local team to 200 people. But Grab is also looking to deploy its digital payment services in Myanmar, as it has done in Indonesia. Its in-app GrabPay wallet is foremost a way to pay fares without using cash, but it has been extended to offer a rewards program in partnership with a range of well-known retailers in a bid to stoke loyalty among Grab passengers.
In Indonesia, Grab is also working to offer payments outside of car services and it looks like it may do the same in Myanmar at some point since credit card ownership is below five percent and the jump to mobile leaves Myanmar open to digital payment systems.
“Our commitment to address transport challenges with locally suited and innovative solutions that create more social and economic opportunity works well for both Grab and our local communities. This is already one of our fastest-growing markets, and we are very excited to deepen our commitment into Myanmar,” Grab CEO Anthony Tan said in a statement.
Outside of mobile operators, Grab is one of the earliest consumer tech companies to make such a commitment to Myanmar. But you can expect more to follow as the opportunities in Myanmar continue to open.",2017-08-24,1531404,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-03-05-2017-10-08-12-am.jpg?w=738,asia/,"grab,myanmar,asia",Grab is investing $100M to shut Uber out of fast-growing Myanmar,uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/grab-is-investing-100m-to-shut-uber-out-of-fast-growing-myanmar/
Anthony Ha,Asia,"WeWork just announced that it’s receiving a massive $4.4 billion investment from SoftBank Group and SoftBank Vision Fund.
It’s been less than a month since WeWork announced $500 million in funding for a standalone WeWork China business, which SoftBank participated in. It’s also launching in Japan through a joint venture with SoftBank — so this funding deepens an already-strong relationship between the coworking company and the Japanese giant.
The companies say the funding breaks down to $3 billion invested in WeWork itself (both through a primary investment and a secondary purchase of existing shares) and $1.4 billion in the companies created for WeWork’s expansion in Asia — namely WeWork China, WeWork Japan and WeWork Pacific. (The $1.4 billion includes SoftBank’s previously announced investment in WeWork China.)
“[SoftBank CEO] Masayoshi Son is a visionary business leader and we are humbled by this strong endorsement of our mission and purpose,” said WeWork co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann (pictured above) in the announcement. “This support from SoftBank and the Vision Fund will provide even more opportunities for creators as we set out to humanize the way people work and live.”

Ingrid Lunden,Asia,"The online food ordering-and-delivery market, once very hot, appears to be cooling down a little in China. Today Baidu, the country’s search giant, announced an exit from the business: Baidu has confirmed that it has sold its Xiaodu food delivery subsidiary (which operates under the Waimai brand) to Rajax, which operates Ele.me, China’s leading food delivery business that is valued at around $6 billion and counts Alibaba, Tencent and Sequoia among its investors. The deal is reportedly valued at around $800 million (see more detailed explanation below) and gives Baidu a small stake in the bigger operation.
In a short statement announcing the news, Baidu said that Xiaodu is now a subsidiary of Rajax and that Baidu and Rajax had inked “a business cooperation across a broad base of products and services following completion of the merger.”
A Baidu spokesperson has declined to disclose the value of the deal. We are continuing to dig around, but as a potential range, consider that when rumors of this sale were first reported a few days ago, it was estimated to be $500 million for the business, plus $300 million in an additional traffic agreement, amounting to an $800 million deal. But also consider that last year, Waimai’s valuation was estimated at around $2.5 billion.
Taken together, this could mean that the price was actually higher today, or that Baidu was particularly keen to offload this asset, even at a knock-down price.
The divestment underscores a persistent fact in the bigger market for online food delivery: the logistics involved plus the investment needed to acquire and keep customers in competitive markets makes food delivery a very cost-intensive business that has proven challenging for many to bring into the black.
Even the biggest players like Delivery Hero, which has gobbled up a number of rivals over the years, and raised well over $1 billion in funding in a play for economies of scale, is not profitable in all of its markets, and overall was still loss-making when it went public earlier this year. (It, too, incidentally pulled out of China last year amid huge competition.) More recently Blue Apron has been feeling the pinch.
That’s before you consider the plethora of smaller startups that have sold up or shut down rather than grown on their own.
In that context, Baidu was a parent with deep pockets and a specific mission: the company has been very keen to grow out from its core search business into a number of adjacent areas that both could help the search business continue to grow, and also help Baidu diversify its own revenue base.
It’s a strategy also taken by other search giants: Google has its own shopping services that it has been trying to build out; Yandex in Russia has built out a number of businesses in areas like on-demand transport and more.
Baidu’s retreat signals not just that it may be pulling away from costly e-commerce ventures like this, but also that its focus is getting stronger on other areas.
Specifically, the company has been doubling down on what is likely going to form the core of the next generation of computing, artificial intelligence, and the many applications that this will take, whether it is in powering services like transportation or providing information to Baidu’s user base. It’s also been making some acquisitions in line with this, such as its purchase of Kitt.ai earlier this summer.
(Notably, other food-related ventures that tap into this new wave of computing, like this one with KFC to facilitate ordering using face recognition technology, will not be affected by today’s news, Baidu confirmed to TC.)
Additionally, Baidu is moving deeper into investing in other areas. The company now collaborating with insurance giant China Life (a partner in other investments) on a new $1 billion private equity fund called the “Baidu Fund Partnership“. Capitalized with 5.6 billion yuan from China Life and 1.4 billion from Baidu, the fund will focus on late-stage investments in tech startups with a significant presence in China with a focus on mobile, AI, and finance.
Baidu may have lost its appetite for the food delivery market for now, but that’s not to say that there are not others who are licking their chops for more.
Ele.me continues to grow massively, and others like Uber and Amazon are also doubling down in this area, building out from their logistics operations as a base for growth. As more of our economy shifts to consumers using digital platforms to buy goods and services, there’s a clear opportunity there for those hungry to seize it.",2017-08-24,1530911,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-626189980.jpg?w=738,asia/,"china,food-delivery,ele-me,baidu",Baidu sells food delivery business to its rival Ele.me,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/baidu-confirms-sale-of-its-food-delivery-business-to-rival-ele-me/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Eko Communications, a U.S.-Thailand company that operates a messaging app targeted at businesses, has closed a strategic investment of $2 million to grow in Japan and expand into Europe and the U.S..
The funding was led by Japanese corporate Itochu, which provided $1 million and will partner to help expand sales. Existing backers of the company, which include Gobi Ventures, also took part.
Eko provides a mobile messaging app that includes a range of productivity and employee development tools baked in. It was founded five years ago by Thai student Korawad Chearavanont while he was studying in New Jersey. We wrote a longer story about the company in 2015 when it raised $5.7 million.
Chearavanont told TechCrunch that the business counts over 150,000 active monthly paying subscribed licenses, that is the total number of employees on the platform from its paying customers. There is also a free service. The company didn’t divulge revenue data, but it said sales has grown by 630 percent over the last year.
Most paying clients are located in Asia, with around 30-40 percent from China, and this new investment will help find deeper growth in Japan while kickstarting its U.S. and UK businesses, having just opened sales offices in those two countries.
“It seems like many Japanese companies are implementing policies that are favorable to use,” he said in an interview. “This is strategic investment to spark a partnership, we saw this as the opportunity to have access to a huge company, with a vast software business in Japan and international reach.”
Chearavanont who is the grandson of Southeast Asia’s richest man — Dhanin Chearavanont — added that he wasn’t initially looking for investment. He said the partnership with Itochu opened this opportunity to push on to gain momentum before a planned Series B round next summer.
“By showing we can grow in huge IT markets, we can justify a large round. That’s what is needed to invest in tech since we compete with global giants like Facebook and Microsoft,” he said, adding that 80 percent of the startup’s expenditure to date has been on product.
While Eko has found success with large corporate companies in Asia — eleven of its clients have a market cap in excess of $2 billion, it claims — it is looking at small businesses for initial traction in Western markets before fanning out to seek larger clients.",2017-08-24,1530890,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-539253463.jpg?w=738,asia/,"eko-communications,computing,software,internet-culture","Business messaging service Eko picks up $2M to fuel push into Japan, US and UK",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/eko-communications-2-million-japan-us-and-uk/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Google is launching its public Wi-Fi program, which offers free connectivity at railway stations and other locations such as universities, in Indonesia, the company announced today.
The Indonesia launch is the first expansion of ‘Google Station’ — as the program is called — since it debuted in India some 18 months ago.
The project is quite simple, it offers a free way to get online with a decent quality internet connection. The idea is that beyond making it easy to get public Wi-Fi — because let’s face it, it is usually a struggle — Google Station offers connectivity those who might otherwise be unable to afford it, or perhaps even unaware of it entirely.
Google works with a range of partners that include ISPs, venue owners and system integrators on the project. It also enlists the help of ISPs and device makers to help get support and optimization for the networks on phones/phone connections themselves and reduce costs.
The project in India began with Mumbai Central station in January 2016, and last September it expanded beyond public transportation to include stations across the country, shopping malls, bus stops, cafes and more. Google claims the service is in over 150 stations, which helps it enable “millions” to go online each day. Interestingly, it claims 15,000 people in India go online for the first time using the public Wi-Fi service each day.
The Indonesia roll-out is targeting “hundreds of venues” across Java (hope to capital city Jakarta) and Bali over the next twelve months. Google said it is working with service providers CBN and FiberStar to bring the idea to life.
In addition, Google also expanded its data-friendly YouTube Go app, which was previously only available in India, to Indonesia.
Indonesia is increasingly a focus for technology companies that see the internet as a game-changer for the country’s 260 million population, that’s the world’s fourth highest. Whether it is fintech, e-commerce or taxis on-demand, the internet has the potential to change daily lives and enable new services, but getting decent access is the critical component.
India has been a key market for most tech companies in recent years, but lately Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, has also begun to command attention in its own right. According to a report co-authored by Google last year, Southeast Asia’s internet economy is projected to grow 6.5-fold to reach $197 billion by 2025. Indonesia is expected to represent around half of that value, and that includes key categories like e-commerce and ride-hailing.",2017-08-23,1530875,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/google-sign.jpg?w=738,asia/,"computing,technology,wireless,wi-fi",Google expands its public Wi-Fi program for emerging markets to Indonesia,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/google-station-indonesia/
Darrell Etherington,Asia,"Automaker Ford will team up with local partner Anhui Zotye Automobile to create a new joint venture in China aimed specifically at producing electric cars. The deal will see Ford and its new partner sell the vehicle sunder a local brand, rather than with its “Ford” name, and ultimately its aim is to produce even more electric vehicles for a market where there is strong incentive to bring EVs to consumers.
This is the third joint venture Ford has set up with local Chinese automakers. It’s standard practice for foreign car companies to partner with local Chinese vehicle producers, as a way to avoid having to pay very high import taxes on vehicles made by exclusively foreign-controlled concerns.
Ford has two JVs set up with other automakers including Changan Automobile and Jiangling Motors, and normally that’s the upper limit for joint ventures allowed by Chinese industry regulators. Recently, however, Beijing added an allotment for a third joint deal, provided its focus is specifically electric vehicle manufacture.
China is doing a lot to boost electric car adoption in the country, including adjusting the rules for automakers in terms of how much of their total output must be EVs. Zotye, Ford’s new partner, is an electric car specialist, with a total of 16,000 EV sales so far in 2017. Overall, Ford is aiming to make sure that 70 percent of the cars its offers in China are electric vehicles by 2025.

Jon Russell,Asia,"While talk of Spotify’s apparent upcoming IPO continues in the U.S., the music streaming service is furthering its coverage of Asia after it launched its service in Thailand.
Spotify Premium, which counts over 60 million paying users, will cost 129 THB in Thailand. That’s just over $4 and in line with its pricing across Asia. Customers in the U.S. and UK will be aware that it is substantially cheaper than what they pay, but Spotify has opted for local pricing worldwide.
Interestingly, Spotify will introduce daily and weekly packages to boost its potential in Thailand, where revenue from online music has actually declined by over 20 percent since 2012, Spotify Asia head Sunita Kaur told media at a press conference
The launch — which we reported was on the cards back in May — takes Spotify to 61 markets worldwide, and it is emblematic of the company’s recent focus on expanding its business in Asia.
Spotify first entered the region in 2013 with launches in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, it only added one new market over the next two years. It restarted its expansion plan in Asia last year when it launched its service in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth largest population, and Japan, which is the world’s second most lucrative music market. Today’s launch takes it to seven countries in Asia, not including Australia and New Zealand when looking at the wider Asia Pacific area.
As we reported back in May, Vietnam is the next country in its sights, as evidenced by job listings and sources. India is a market that we understand Spotify has looked at seriously, but for now it has not committed to a launch.
Getting a solid position across Asia will help Spotify when it does finally go public. The latest reports suggest that will be via a direct listing, an unorthodox approach that involves going public without an IPO. Spotify is potentially missing out on hundreds of millions in proceeds from the IPO, but it could do a secondary offering to raise cash at a later date.
It’s also under pressure to compete with Apple Music, which is available worldwide. Spotify had an early head-start and it added 20 million paid subscribers in less than a year. It’s taken Apple Music more than a year and a half to make that progress. Spotify now has 60 million subscribers, compared to Apple Music’s 27 million, as of June.",2017-08-21,1529565,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/gettyimages-506028296.jpg?w=738,asia/,"computing,initial-public-offering,online-music-stores,software",Spotify launches in Thailand to continue its Asia push,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/spotify-thailand-launch/
Jon Russell,Asia,"German automotive giant Continental is furthering its push into the future of transportation after it got its check book out to acquire Quantum Inventions, a Singapore-based company that specializes in mobility data services.
The deal was announced in July with little fanfare and it is officially undisclosed, but a source told TechCrunch that it is around the SG$40 million mark — that works out to around $29 million. That’s a pretty significant exit — both in name of acquirer and deal size — for Southeast Asia’s nascent yet promising tech ecosystem.
You’d be hard pressed to call Quantum Inventions a startup, although it certainly operating in startup style. The company was founded in 2006, over ten years ago, and it has 120 staff across offices in Singapore, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. It is focused on ‘mobility solutions’ in the consumer, automotive and government/enterprise sectors. That’s a fairly broad term but essentially it means managing data to make navigation-related services run smarter and more efficiently.
One example is the work that the company has done in Singapore, where its technology has been used to used to the government develop a new satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing system, which handles tolls, parking and other fees and is designed to ease congestion. Quantum Inventions works with a Mitsubishi affiliate, which won the project’s tender, and Singapore’s NCS to manage the vast data output to glean insight and information.
“Compliance from technical standpoint very important,” Saurav Bhattacharyya, Quantum Inventions CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. “Human compliance in any kind of system is the main issue, moving towards autonomous or advanced systems you have higher level of compliance and that’s where a central-backed congestion management platform in real-time can get to many places.”
The company doesn’t just focus on smart cities — though that is a strength of Singapore — and its other units touch on enterprise services like fleet management, in-car consumer services, and mobile apps and data such as navigation.
Bhattacharyya said that right now, mobility data is managed in commonly managed in silos, but he said this practice will change in the future as increased usage of the cloud and city planning centralizes data and processes.
The business itself had become profitable with 50 percent compound growth over the past decade, so why sell now when the future is still to come?
Bhattacharyya said the initial plan was to go to market to raise funding, but after being subject to acquisition interest, Quantum Inventions looked at its options. Beyond a financial exit for investors and the team, he said it was drawn to Continental as a partner that can open doors while adding tech and other resources.
“We had a few suitors over the last year, one of the important things for us was to ensure we have a company that knows it takes R&D to stay ahead and have global relationships,” he said. “You can raise $100 million but can’t buy relationships.”
On that latter point, he expects that his company will be able to develop much faster with more resources at its fingertips.
“We come in as a strong engineering fit,” Bhattacharyya added. While the deal “leaves us independent, with the backing of Continental’s global channels — that’s testament to what we have created.”
For now the plan is to continue the business as it is — with an enrichment of resources — but in the future as the market changes, so the business may also shift its focus.
“We will keep our verticals but may align to certain strengths or relationships that Continental has, but still covering automotive and cities. Logistics is very strong and we’ll intend to keep doing that, maybe couple of years down the line makes sense to harmonize platform into one,” he explained.
Continental has been busy brokering deals in Asia lately. It recently announced a joint venture with operator China Unicom focused on transport systems, and it has partnered with Baidu to develop self-driving cars.
“Asia continues to play an ever increasing role in our strategy,” Helmut Matschi, member of the Executive Board at Continental and head of the Interior division, said in a statement. “Now the purchase of Quantum Inventions underline our focus on developing mobility services solutions. We are excited to provide an expanded portfolio of customized solutions in the dynamic mobility services market.”",2017-08-21,1527416,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shutterstock_244507771.jpg?w=738,asia/,"blogs,business,world-wide-web,economy",Auto giant Continental buys Singapore-based Quantum Inventions for $29M,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/auto-giant-continental-buys-singapore-based-quantum-inventions-for-29m/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"The startup behind the Prisma style transfer app is shifting focus onto the b2b space, building tools for developers that draw on its expertise using neural networks and deep learning technology to power visual effects on mobile devices.
It’s launched a new website, Prismalabs.ai, detailing this new offering.
Initially, say Prisma’s co-founders, they’ll be offering an SDK for developers wanting to add effects like style transfer and selfie lenses to their own apps — likely launching an API mid next week.
Then, in the “next month or so”, they also plan to offer another service for developers wanting help to port their code to mobile. This was, after all, how the co-founders originally came up with the idea for the Prisma app — having seen a style transfer effect working (slowly) on a desktop computer and realized how much potential it would have if it could be made to work in near real-time on mobile.
“The first plan is ready to go solution when you have an idea and want to implement, for example, style transfer or object recognition or something like face masks… or Snapchat lenses,” says CEO and co-founder Alexey Moiseenkov, fleshing out what’s coming from Prisma Labs. “If you need this ability we can offer you a ready to go SDK that you can implement in your app.”
Co-founder Aram Airapetyan gives an example of how their AI-powered image segmentation technology could also be used to allow users of Skype — for example —  to push a button to change or blank out the background during a video call. (Meaning this wouldn’t have to happen, for example.)
The wave of augmented reality apps that are coming down the smartphone pipe, driven by more powerful hardware and active encouragement from mobile platforms, could also help generate demand for Prisma’s effects, reckons Moiseenkov, as they can offer object tracking as well as face tracking via APIs or an SDK.
“The second part [of the b2b offering] is we feel that in a lot of companies developers are struggling with porting technologies to mobile,” he continues. “And we feel that we can offer them our own solution that we use internally — internally we have… a platform that can help us to experiment with our research and producing a lot of demo apps for internal usage and choosing the right one.”
They say they’ve been testing the developer tools with “some very big companies” — but won’t name any names as yet.
“We want to explore the CV [computer vision] area and help companies also produce a greater user experience with AI — helping people to communicate easier, to solve their tasks,” adds Moiseenkov.
“We feel that AI can help a lot of companies to improve the user experience a lot. The camera, working with images, filtering, de-noising, a lot of different stuff can happen — and that’s cool. I feel it can improve the overall quality of apps in App Store and Google Play.”
Prisma’s consumer app shot to painterly popularity last summer, offering smartphone users the ability to transform a standard smartphone photo by quickly and easily applying different graphical styles — to create, for example, a pastiche of a particular artwork or graphical effect.
The app achieved its effects not by applying filters to the photo but by utilizing neural networks and deep learning to process the original photo in the chosen style — generating a new image that combined both input sources.
By December last year, Prisma had racked up around 70 million downloads and earned itself a bunch of app store accolades. But it also attracted the attention of platform giants like Facebook who quickly rolled out style transfer features of their own — helping to cap the app’s momentum.
The team then experimented with adding social elements to the style transfer tool, to see if they could turn Prisma into a social platform in its own right — although, given how dominated the consumer social/messaging space is, by giants like Facebook and WeChat, that always looked like a forlorn hope.
Branching into b2b looks a more solid strategic step for Prisma, positioning the team to offer developers an accelerated route for burnishing the feature-set/UX of their own apps, and selling these b2b services with the help of demonstrable AI-powered visual effects expertise.
So although Prisma is shifting its monetization strategy (likely a usage-based SDK for the visual effects; and maybe a licensing model for the platform, it says), its consumer apps aren’t going away. Indeed, they now double as both testing ground and showcase for what its tech can do for other developers.
“Since the start of this year we were thinking about exploring our opportunities in terms of how to earn money in an efficient way, and we decided to go where we can help companies with computer vision or AI — in terms of more consumer-oriented applications,” Moiseenkov tells TechCrunch.
“We focus on effects; video effects on a mobile camera… We feel this is a really rich area for a company like ours. And also we feel that with our apps in the market we can experiment a lot with different technologies and this pairing can do a lot for us in terms of earning money.”
“We have a very strong R&D team,” adds Airapetyan. “We have lots of guys who are researching and investigating what we can do in terms of different technologies and AI-based products so we’ve been working on these technologies for a while.”
The team launched a second consumer app in July: a sticker-maker called Sticky that uses AI algorithms to perform quick cut-outs of selfies so they can be easily repurposed as colorful stickers.
Across both apps they say they’re getting between 5M to 10M MAUs [monthly active users] and ~500,000 DAUs [daily active users] at this point — with Airapetyan describing their user base as “very stable”.
Prisma’s own team is around 25-strong, split between offices in the Bay Area and Moscow. Though they say they’re also eyeing setting up a base in China — seeing “huge” potential to sell AI-related services in such a large and visually engaged app ecosystem.
The team has previously raised seed funding, although it has never disclosed how much. According to Crunchbase investors in its seed include Gagarin Capital Partners, Haxus and Nikolai Oreshkin. (Notably Haxus was also an investor in Fabby, a computer vision app recently acquired by Google.)
Moiseenkov says Prisma hasn’t raised any funding since the end of last year, and is not currently looking to raise — they want to see how their b2b play plays out first, he adds.
On the competition front for b2b CV/AI tools, he points to a couple of big companies in Asia offering similar services already — such as Face++.  He also name checks Clarifai as another competitor offering image recognition, as well as Google’s image processing APIs — though he claims Google isn’t offering developers a lot of choice vs the plan for Prisma Labs.
“We are working on a very, very wide-range of AI-based technologies,” adds Airapetyan.",2017-08-19,1528433,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-18-08-2017-22-56-40.jpg?w=738,asia/,"visual-effects,style-transfer,ai,prisma",Prisma shifts focus to b2b with an API for AI-powered mobile effects,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/19/prisma-shifts-focus-to-b2b-with-an-api-for-ai-powered-mobile-effects/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Alibaba has continued its push into Southeast Asia after it led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia, an e-commerce firm based in Indonesia.
A valuation for the deal was not announced, but the companies did say that Alibaba has become a minority shareholder.
Tokopedia, which was founded in 2009, operates a marketplace that allows small retailers and large brands to sell to consumers in Indonesia, which is Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The company previously raised $100 million from SoftBank and Sequoia in 2014, and it counts East Ventures, CyberAgent and Beenos Partners among its early backers. Tokopedia said a number of undisclosed existing investors also took part in this newest round.
“The partnership with Alibaba will enhance the scale and quality of Tokopedia’s offerings to its customers and make it easier for merchants and partners to do business across the archipelago and beyond,” the companies said in an announcement.
“We have always thought of Alibaba as our teacher and role model,” Tokopedia CEO and co-founder William Tanuwijaya said in a statement. “Today, we are excited to welcome them as a shareholder and we believe that our partnership will further accelerate Tokopedia’s mission, to democratize commerce through technology.”
There’s plenty at stake in Southeast Asia. A recent report co-authored by Google predicted that annual e-commerce spend in the region will jump from $5.5 billion in 2015 to $88 billion in 2025. It estimated that half of that revenue will come from Indonesia, which is the world’s fourth largest country.
Tokopedia had been heavily linked with an investment from China lately, with sources telling TechCrunch last month that it had held talks with both Alibaba and JD.com, a rival company backed by Tencent.
Alibaba announced another blockbuster quarter of business today, which included impressive growth from its overseas commerce businesses. The firm credit Lazada, the Southeast Asia-based marketplace it invested $2 billion in, for growing its international commerce revenue by 136 percent to 2.6 billion RMB ($389 million). While that is only a small portion of its total revenue of 50.2 billion CNY ($7.4 billion), Alibaba is clearly bullish on Southeast Asia and this Tokopedia investment reaffirms that.
The deal marks the second major investment in a startup from Indonesia in the past month. Expedia put $350 million into booking platform Traveloka in a deal that valued the startup at more than $1 billion. Earlier this year, Go-Jek agreed to a new $1.2 billion round led by Tencent. That deal hasn’t been announced but TechCrunch understands that it will be made official soon.",2017-08-17,1527968,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-17-08-2017-7-52-37-pm.jpg?w=738,asia/,"alibaba-group,e-commerce,tokopedia,economy",Alibaba leads $1.1B investment in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/alibaba-tokopedia/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Alibaba had another blockbuster quarter of business as its profits almost doubled.
The Chinese e-commerce giant reported net profit of 14 billion RMB ($2.1 billion) for its recent quarter that finished June 30 — that’s up 96 percent year-on-year. Total revenue grew 56 percent to reach 50.2 billion CNY ($7.4 billion), easily exceeding estimates, with the firm reporting 466 million active buyers over the previous 12-month period.
Alibaba’s core commerce business brought in the majority of revenue — 43 billion ($6.4 billion) — but its 58 percent annual growth was topped by its smaller business units. That’s a sign of the future, according to CEO Daniel Zhang.
“Alibaba had a strong start to fiscal 2018, reflecting the strength and diversity of our businesses and the value we bring to customers on our platforms. Our technology is driving significant growth across our business and strengthening our position beyond core commerce,” Zhang said.
Of those units, its aggressive cloud computing business, which TechCrunch profiled earlier this year, was one of the more impressive. It grew 96 percent to reach 2.4 billion RMB ($359 million) in revenue while losses narrowed to 103 million RMB, or $15 million. The company noted that its cloud computing customer base passed one million for the first time.
Alibaba’s digital media and entertainment business, which includes video service Youku Tudou, saw revenue jump 30 percent to four billion RMB ($602 million).
The company has spent the past year expanding its business outside of China, which this quarter again shows accounts for the lion’s share of revenue, and the results are beginning to bear fruit. Alibaba said its international e-commerce services reached “meaningful scale” with 2.6 billion RMB ($389 million) in revenue. It credited Lazada, its business in Southeast Asia which it recently invested a further $1 billion in this year, and AliExpress for increasing revenue by 136 percent from last year.

Jon Russell,Apps,"Google might soon release a data-friendly version of its search app for mobile.
That’s because the company is currently piloting such an app in Indonesia, as the eagle-eyed team at Android Police first spotted.
“Search Lite” — which TechCrunch understands is not the name of the app, but it is certainly an accurate description of it — is essentially a modified version of the Google search app that’s optimized for those using poor quality connections, with limited mobile data allocations, or in possession of a smartphone with little internal memory.
In that respect it’s similar to the YouTube Lite app that Google launched in India last year, and other ‘lite’ apps from Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. India has been a core market for these data-friendly apps and there are clues within the app that this Google app is headed to India soon.
Beyond offering an easier way to search the web, the app connects to other content including news, weather and Google’s Translate service. There’s an option to navigate to external websites inside the app’s dedicated browser, a move that would seemingly save on data, too.

Google declined to comment on the app specifically.
“We’re always experimenting with our products with the goal of providing the most useful and optimal experience for our users. This is a new experimental app to help improve the search experience for users in Indonesia,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
Beyond individual apps, Google is putting serious focus on developing services that are optimized for emerging markets, where it sees the next billion internet users coming online. It is developing a lightweight version of Android — Android Go — to power smartphones, and has made strategic acquisitions in Southeast Asia and most recently India to build out engineering teams that are dedicated to emerging markets.",2017-08-17,1527924,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/google-shop131.jpg?w=738,asia/,"google-search,software,computing",Google is testing a data-friendly version of its Search app,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/google-data-friendly-search-app-lite/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs to show off their mixing skills, has been acquired by BandLab Technologies, the Singapore-based ‘social’ music-making platform. Terms of the deal are undisclosed, though it was widely known that Chew.tv, which has been described as ‘Twitch for DJs,’ had been struggling financially over the last six months.
Originally a graduate of accelerator Ignite, Chew.tv launched in 2015 as an online community for aspiring and professional DJs, with an emphasis on live video. The premise being that dance music DJs are both content consumers and creators, and that Chew.tv could serve both needs, allowing DJs at different levels to learn from and be inspired by each other — not entirely dissimilar to online gamers.
That appeared to find some traction, seeing Chew garner an undoubtedly loyal and passionate user base. In July, it disclosed that the service had a community of 380,000+ users, who, since launch, have collectively created over 120,000 hours of content.
With that said, Chew.tv narrowly avoided the deadpool earlier this year after its streaming infrastructure was “heavily misused” by a nefarious hacker the previous December. “The abuse cost is more than we can afford, and the combined total of that and our regular running costs is enough to put us out of business,” the company emailed users in March.
However, in a nice turn of events, Chew’s community rallied together under the #savedchew hashtag, and via £12,000 in donations and an increase in premium subscriptions, the service was saved and the startup, which was down to a single staff member in co-founder Will Benton, lived to fight another day. Which brings us to today’s acquisition.
I’m told that BandLab has acquired all technology & IP of the Chew platform. “We’re not disclosing dollar amounts for the deal. This was a privately funded deal – we worked to find a fair price that both parties were happy with,” says a BandLab spokesperson.
Meanwhile, BandLab​ ​Technologies says Chew.tv will be rebranded as “Chew by BandLab”. In addition, the startup’s live streaming technology will be integrated into BandLab’s web platform, Android and iOS apps “for use by BandLab’s existing user base of close to 2 million users”.
“I am very pleased that Chew will now be supported by the BandLab team. For the past two years I’ve been closely watching the growth and development of this great platform and community of DJs,” said Meng Ru Kuok, BandLab CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “One of the most important parts of being a musician today is performing live, and as an extension of that, it’s extremely important for us to be able to digitally support creators and musicians who want to bring their live performances to the world”.",2017-09-06,1535994,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image-bandlab-welcomes-chew-to-the-family.jpg?w=738,startups/,chew,"BandLab​ ​Technologies​ acquires Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/bandlab%e2%80%8b-%e2%80%8btechnologies%e2%80%8b-acquires-chew-tv/
Devin Coldewey,Augmented Reality,"For someone getting major dental work or reconstructive surgery, it can be hard to visualize what they’ll look like afterwards. You can do casts and make wax molds, but that’s a bit… 19th century, isn’t it? A Swiss startup brings the, in retrospect, obvious solution of augmented reality to the problem, giving patients a virtual view of the smile they could soon have.
The company, Kapanu, is a spin-off of Swiss technical university ETH Zurich; CEO Roland Mörzinger and his team created an augmented reality engine for medical purposes, and dentistry was chosen as a good first application. (Disney Research was involved with early research at ETHZ but not, as I had written here before, with Kapanu’s final project.)
It works by matching a 3D scan of the person’s mouth cavity (a procedure many dentists do already) to scans of known sets of good teeth already used for this kind of thing. Once the software locks onto the user’s mouth and teeth, it overlays the improved teeth — and that’s where the fun starts. There are options the user can then tweak: how close the teeth are, various shapes and spacing and so on. All the changes are visible live.

Once the patient has customized their teeth and given them a preview in the AR “virtual mirror,” the final model is sent off for manufacture wherever it is replacement teeth are made.
The system was shown at the International Dental Show in Cologne last winter, and apparently they were mobbed. It clearly impressed the big players in this corner of the health world: this June Kapanu was acquired by Ivoclar Vivadent. No word on the terms, but the company is operating independently.
It’s a nice success story for augmented reality, which often is relegated to applications that are little more than toys. A real business with everyday applications that tangibly benefit people — imagine that!",2017-09-05,1536468,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/smile.jpg?w=738,startups/,eth-zurich,"Smile, you’re in augmented reality dentistry",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/smile-youre-in-augmented-reality-dentistry/
Devin Coldewey,Gaming,"Game development is a risky business — in the literal sense, that is. Hoping a title becomes a million-seller and justifies its staff and years of gestation often leads to the ruin of game studios and publishers. And that’s if the game ever even releases. But Good Shepherd has found that careful curation, help with pain points like localization, and other avenues of stewardship can make games as reliable an investment as a mutual fund, but considerably more profitable.
The company, founded in 2011 as Gambitious but eventually (and I’d say wisely) rebranding under the current name, basically finds promising games and makes sure they get the best chance at success possible. And it works: they’ve helped usher 15 games into the world, 12 of which have been out for at least a year and 9 of which are already profitable. The portfolio as a whole is turning a 30 percent profit.
More easily said than done. Independent game developers aren’t exactly widget makers; even promising titles can and do end up in development hell as the narrative is reworked, scope is adjusted, art styles are redone, and so on. A good publisher or backer will make sure these don’t torpedo the whole project.
The idea isn’t particularly original — it’s the kind of work that many venture funds and incubators do with young, inexperienced companies — but it hasn’t really been applied to games. Part of that is the perception that games are either hits or whiffs, making it a risky area for investment — although the same could, of course, be said of startups.
But the strategy of a huge release hopefully recouping all costs in a month or two is peculiar to AAA development; the latest Call of Duty costs a hundred million to make, so needs to sell 2 million copies before mainstream gamers move on to the next big franchise release.
An indie game doesn’t have the benefit of an Activision-size marketing team or simultaneous release in 36 countries and languages. But its budget is smaller, and people will continue buying it for years — because often the point of indie games is that they are original creations not bound to any particular console or sales cycle. Cave Story, for instance, is just as awesome today as it was in 2004 — and it still sells.

Understanding these debit and credit columns for a class of asset is critical to making a smart investment, and that’s what Good Shepherd has focused on. I talked with Mike Wilson, co-founder of Devolver and Good Shepherd, while he was in town for PAX West. He said that the company is intensely focused on the writing, music, and other truly original parts of games — the kind of things people talk about for years.
“The magic of what we’ve done is to remove the ‘hit’ requirement for making investing in indie games a reasonable thing to do,” Wilson told me. “We are very sensitive to giving these people a great first experience that isn’t reliant on hitting the lottery with a project breaking into the mainstream.”
	
On the other side of the business, Good Shepherd is meant to be a reliable, transparent investment vehicle for people who want to back games but don’t have any idea how to go directly to creators. Acting as intermediary to investors and critical oversight for creators, the company gets to have its cake and eat it too: out one end comes money, and out the other end comes art.
Considering the pedigree of the people involved (people from the games industry who have always pushed back against AAA studios) the latter would seem to be the primary goal. If you could enable people all over the world to pursue their dreams and build something cool, wouldn’t you? Fortunately, it also happens to produce quite a bit of money, which justifies it for everyone else.",2017-09-05,1536255,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/shep_head.jpg?w=738,startups/,,Good games make good investments at Good Shepherd,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/good-games-make-good-investments-at-good-shepherd/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Lightricks, the company behind the popular selfie-correcting app called Facetune, is adding to its line of mobile photography and editing tools with the recent launch of a new app called Quickshot. Like its other efforts in this space, Quickshot aims to make photo editing more accessible to amateurs. However, in this case, the app’s focus is to assist with taking photos, not just correcting them after the fact.
The app’s name references one tool in particular – a “quickshot” mode which will automatically align your photos, fix the lighting and preview filters before you even snap the picture. The idea is that you’ll be able to take better photos if you can see what they’ll look like before you press the capture button.
Other modes include the “strobe” mode that lets you capture action and movement by mimicking strobe lights and long exposures, and an “HDR” mode that helps with tricky lighting situations.

Beyond these different camera modes, the app also ships with a range of adjustable presets for various scenes, like portraits, nature, urban, and more. That way, novice photographers don’t have to fiddle with various settings to take the best photo, while more advanced users can load a preset then tweak it further to their liking.

The ability to customize your filter in order to give your photos a unique, personalized look is something that draws people to other top photo apps, like Instagram, Snapseed, and VSCO, for example. But with Quickshot, the larger idea is to combine favorite tools like photo filters with Lightricks’ understanding of making photo edits easier through tricks like instant fixes and other tools that can speed up the process.
For example, Quickshot’s batch editor that lets you adjust a single style – like the filter, brightness, depth and more – and then apply it multiple images all at once.

Quickshot is the latest app in a growing lineup of apps from Lightricks, which has been aiming to capitalize on its success with Facetune to launch a subscription business for its creativity tools. Earlier this summer, it debuted a new photo editor called Enlight Photofox, which is basically the upgraded version of the existing Enlight app.
It’s still somewhat rare to see this strategy play out on today’s App Store. Developers are often expected to roll out new features as upgrades to existing apps, not as new ones. Tweetbot, a Twitter client, has been one exception to this rule, which applies more so to apps than games. It’s far more common for sequels to arrive as their own standalone games, as with Monument 2, for instance.
Like Enlight Photofox and Facetune 2, Quickshot is also a subscription offering. While the app itself is free, an “unlimited access subscription” offers all the app’s features and content, for either $1.99 per month, $0.83 per month if you pay for a year upfront, or $19.99 for life.
Because of this model, Quickshot is getting slammed in the App Store reviews from those who feel like it doesn’t offer enough features to justify this pricing. The app currently has a 2.3-star rating (out of 5). This, unfortunately, speaks to a larger problem with the App Store’s business model – developers who believe their work is worth paying for are penalized because there are so many free alternatives available they have to compete against, and because the App Store has propagated the belief that because apps are small, they should cost less than desktop software.
Lightricks, before the shift to subscriptions, sold a healthy 11 million paid downloads of its apps. But despite the pushback from users about subscriptions, the company claims they’ve enabled it to increase revenues.
“Regarding the pivot to subscription model we can definitely confirm that there has a been a significant uptick in revenue run rates,” says Itai Tsiddon, Lightricks co-founder. “However, at this time, we are not yet disclosing specific numbers,” he says, adding that the company will release more details around the end of year.",2017-09-05,1536148,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/quickshot-ios.jpg?w=738,startups/,"photography,photos,apps,lightricks","Facetune maker’s latest app, Quickshot, helps you take better photos",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facetune-makers-latest-app-quickshot-helps-you-take-better-photos/

Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Used to be when we thought about identity as it relates to computers and software, it involved a person logging into an application or service. Increasingly though, you also have machines and sensors attempting to authenticate as they access your systems.
That creates complications for identity management vendors because instead of managing thousands or tens of thousands of identities, it could require scaling to millions or even hundreds of millions logons. ForgeRock, a seven year old identity startup says it has built an identity platform with those kinds of scale requirements in mind.
The approach appears to be resonating with investors. Today, the company announced an $88 million Series D investment round led by Accel with participation from KKR, Meritech Capital Partners and Foundation Capital. Today’s investment brings the total to more than $140 million raised to-date.
CEO Mike Ellis sees his company’s approach to identity as a natural extension of what’s happening the industry. “The relationships between humans, devices, things and services is driving security,” he says. He believes it’s also driving new applications for identity and new business opportunities.
It’s something the company has been building towards from the earliest days, a platform than can scale to deal with identity from a variety of sources beyond just human users. “We believe you have to exist everywhere — at the device and gateway level like a connected car, but also on prem and in cloud,” he said.
Ellis admits that his company has flown under the radar compared with better-known identity companies like Ping Identity, which was sold last year for $600 million to Vista Equity and Okta, which went public in May. But he says the timing of the big round is not a coincidence.
He firmly believes as tech makes the shift to machine-to-machine and sensor-to-machine communications in massive numbers, it’s going to require a new kind of identity platform to deal with the volume that will entail. He also not surprisingly sees his company well positioned to take advantage of that shift.
He’s so confident in fact, he says that today’s investment is the first step toward an IPO. That tends to be information that startup CEOs keep close to the vest, but he is not bashful about saying that is his goal.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Aifloo, a Swedish startup that combines hardware sensors and AI to offer a ‘smart wristband’ to help care for the elderly, has raised €5.1 million in new funding.
The Series A round is led by EQT Ventures, with the VC firm’s Analytics Partner, Henrik Landgren, citing the team and technology as reasons to invest, noting that the e-health company is marrying “vast amounts of data and modern AI” to help elderly people remain living independently for longer.
Founded by Felix Etzler, Michael Collaros and Anders Widgren in 2015, Aifloo is described as an e-health system designed to improve the quality of life for the elderly and provide peace of mind for relatives and caregivers.
The hardware is a wristband packed full of sensors and the AI monitors the wearer’s behaviour so as to alert caregivers of any potentials issues. These are cited as things like trips or falls, alterations in eating habits, and changes in sleep behaviour.
“Aifloo is a completely new e-health system that continually learns about an individual’s behavior – detecting if something is wrong,” explains Etzler. “We help seniors to keep going strong, give peace of mind to family and friends and augment the care delivered by professional caregivers”.
The idea, says the Aifloo founder, is to “digitalize detection of human behaviour in a non-intrusive way”. Specifically, the Aifloo wristband is conceived as a discreet wearable with a long battery life, whilst the real-time cloud AI-analysis does the heavy lifting.
“The service measures trends over time, detects emergencies and alerts people of a problem even if you’re unable to,” he says. “We hope to help carers deliver the right care, at the right time, to those who need it the most, with a little help from technology”.
That, argues Etzler, is very different to the status quo in which the systems used in care are outdated. “A lot of resource goes into manual surveillance,” he says, while more modern solutions are “expensive, not customisable to the individual, or complicated”.
“On the other hand, wearables are targeting the young and healthy or focused on one medical condition, such as diabetes. We’ve created an individualized, durable, easy to use, long-lived solution to a complex problem and packaged it in a nice, wearer friendly product and service”.
To that end, an early customer of Aifloo is Aleris, one of the leading healthcare companies in Scandinavia. Etzler says the next step is begin marketing the service to in-home care companies.",2017-09-05,1535299,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/aifloobandmancoffee-high-1.jpg?w=738,startups/,eqt-ventures,"Aifloo, a Swedish startup that sells a ‘smart wristband’ to help care for the elderly, raises €5.1M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/aifloo/
Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"GetAccept co-founder Mathias Thulin is very familiar with a common problem sales representatives have: they have a great meeting with a potential customer, fire off an email to follow up on that deal and send a thank you note, and then hear nothing back.
With all these leads going dark, Thulin and his co-founder Samir Smajic wanted to dig into the data to figure out what was happening. To do that, they decided to start GetAccept, an e-signature service that helps representatives track their documents and help close those deals. The start-up today said that it has raised $1.6 million in a seed funding round from Amino Capital and Y Combinator, as well as other angel investors. GetAccept came out of Y Combinator in 2016.
“Too many times you had a great meeting that you just said, ah I love this, send me a proposal and I will talk with my manager and get back to you next week,” Thulin said. “Then, they just go dark. There are much more decision-makers involved that they tell you about, and also that it’s so hard to understand how engaged they actually are. You don’t know what’s happening after you sent the proposal. It’s so easy to ignore your inbox and phone when you try to follow-up with a sales rep.”
Internally, GetAccept analyses a sales representative’s behavior to see why they are closing on more deals, or vice versa. It looks for cues, like a sales representative including a product demo or the company connecting directly through a chat bot that then connects them directly to another representative. These sales representatives can also lean on retargeting, chasing their leads across platforms in order to build that awareness. Thulin argues that it’s all these light touches that can help companies close that deal, but often times they just go overlooked.

He also likes to say that his startup is based on artificial intelligence — though you won’t find it at the deep, complex level of a convolutional neural network. But there is certainly some learning happening in the background, with algorithms studying the behavior of the best sales people and the trick and quirks they have that are helping them close better sales leads. It’s not some kind of hardcore AI that would come out of a lab at Stanford, but this kind of self-reflecting software is a hallmark of many emerging enterprise sales startups that look to help businesses streamline their processes.
“If we could find the triggers that could help push the deal forward, we would do it,” Smajic said. “We see that it’s really for different reasons why sales reps can push the lead forward. If [potential customers] don’t open the document in 24 hours, then we definitely need to address it. We also see another case that if they forward it to other people [in the organization] that the deal will be postponed because there are people involved. We figured out we couldn’t use generic tools, and that was the reason.”
GetAccept, with this seed funding, still faces an uphill battle against e-signature companies like DocuSign and lead tracking from existing lead-tracking CRM start-ups like Gong or Attach. Those are two very significant markets, though Smajic says that by targeting a product that does both of them will help them outmaneuver the companies that look to eventually dig into each others’ territories. Getting there first will help, though it remains to be seen if they will be able to get the kind of widespread adoption that these companies have already built up.",2017-09-04,1535201,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/founders_20171.jpg?w=738,startups/,,GetAccept raises $1.6M to help companies close sales leads faster,y-combinator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/getaccept-raises-1-6m-to-help-companies-close-sales-leads-faster/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Habito, a London startup that is bringing the entire mortgage process online, has raised £18.5 million in Series B funding. Atomico, the European VC firm founded by Skype’s Niklas Zennström, led the round, with participation from existing investors Ribbit Capital, Mosaic Ventures, and Revolutionary (Ad)Ventures. It brings the total raised by the U.K. company to just over £27 million.
More interestingly, Habito, which probably counts Trussle as its closest direct competitor, says the new capital will in part be used to integrate its technology with major retail banks and high street lenders to facilitate “real-time mortgage approvals”, in addition to marketing and other product development. The startup says it also plans to expand its offering to other parts of the mortgage process, namely home and life insurance.
Calling itself a “digital mortgage broker,” Habito was founded by Daniel Hegarty, who was previously an early employee at Wonga, to remove a lot of the friction when applying for a mortgage. The company’s tech claims to analyse over 11,000 mortgage products across 70
lenders in real-time, to help identify the most suitable mortgage based on your individual circumstances. The entire application process can then be completed via the Habito app/website for free, thus eliminating the fees that most traditional mortgage brokers charge.
There is, however, an additional aspect to the Habito premise, and one that has the potential to be quite disruptive beyond pricing. Once you’ve signed up to the app and entered all of the required details related to your eligibility and your current mortgage and property (if you have one), the startup will effectively become your broker going forward.
This sees its tech continually monitor the mortgage products available on the market and alert you if it thinks you have become mismatched and therefore are paying over the odds. The idea is to make switching also as frictionless as possible. That’s because, says Habito, 1 in 4 British homeowners are currently mismatched, paying lenders an average of around £4,000 more than they need to every year.
“Fintech companies are tackling a lot of traditional areas that are ready for a new approach. This is one of them,” Atomico Partner Niall Wass tells TechCrunch. “Matching borrowers and lenders in the residential mortgage space is slow, expensive and very fragmented – with around 15,000 largely offline brokers in the U.K. But the potential is not just in the U.K., it’s across multiple markets with the same problem.”
However, despite describing the Habito value proposition for both borrowers and lenders as being pretty clear, Wass says one challenge the startup faces is the degree of apathy by house owners when it comes to remortgaging.
“This apathy is why there is such massive overspend in this market globally – perhaps because the process to move to a better mortgage has been so slow and complicated. So the first challenge is continuing to make the process simple, speedy, free and with a better outcome for the borrower. This is absolutely key,” he says.
“I love the idea that Habito has your back and will check the market automatically for a better deal for you – but that kind of message has to get out, so the next challenge is to help build the brand”.
In addition, the Atomico VC says that Habito will need to further prove the benefits to lenders too by using more technology to make it easier and cheaper to “assess the customer risk and matching them to the most appropriate product”. Hence plans to integrate with major retail banks and high street lenders at the technology level.",2017-09-03,1535517,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/habito-press-image-2.jpg?w=738,startups/,"atomico,trussle","Habito, an app that helps you find the right mortgage, raises £18.5M Series B led by Atomico",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/03/habito-atomico/

The connected life is not necessarily the good life. Too often, it seems like we are squandering our time checking devices, losing touch with fellow humans and cultivating bad habits in the pursuit of instant gratification.
If only an app could fix that. Preferably, it’d be one we could use all day long and did not require interacting with humans. It’d be nice to download in a couple of minutes, too.
Welcome to the world of mindfulness and wellness apps. In the past year or so, investors have backed more than 20 startups developing apps and tools aimed at promoting mindfulness, happiness and other desirable mental states. To date, these companies have raised more than $150 million, according to Crunchbase data. Several of the largest rounds have been in recent months, with the vast majority of funding going to California-based startups.
Take a deep breath, and we’ll take a deeper dive into where all that money is going.
So far, the largest funding recipient is Headspace, developer of a popular app for learning meditation techniques. The Santa Monica-based company, which closed a $37 million round in June, has raised $75 million to date. It’s a fairly straightforward business model: users start with a few free lessons and subscribe if they want to keep going.
Headspace bills itself as the world’s most popular meditation app, with more than 18 million downloads. Its mission, however, is much broader.
“Meditation is just the first act,” says Ross Hoffman, Headspace’s chief business officer. Over time, the seven-year-old startup wants to build “the most comprehensive guide to health and happiness from when you’re born to when you die and everything in between.”
It’s in expansion mode, too, committed to what might be called happy scaling. The careers page features images of an open office space complete with sweater-knit upholstered sofas and blissful staffers nibbling salad and steamed rice. Job applicants are asked to explain how they see their role impacting the company vision of improving the health and happiness of the world.
There are also other well-funded startups in the space dedicated to making us feel better. Happify Health, a developer of digital tools and programs it says are “designed to motivate individuals to address the full range of their emotional needs,” has raised $25 million. And Grokker, a provider of online yoga, meditation and fitness lessons, brought in $22 million.
There are lots of other interesting-sounding companies that have raised seed and early-stage funding. The list includes Calm, a Headspace rival, Shine, an app that sends motivational text messages and Thrive Global, which wants to help busy people avoid burnout.
Initial snarkiness aside, apps geared to more balanced living do appear to fill a niche in our over-connected lives. Moreover, while there may be some irony in using devices to cure the ills of digital overstimulation, there’s also some logic.
“Technology has been the bridge that makes us more aware of everything on the planet… But it also causes us to be the multi-taskers we are and to have thousands of friends but to be lonely,” says Stuart Rudick, founding partner at Mindful Investors, a socially conscious micro VC fund. Mindful’s portfolio includes Muse, developer of a brain-sensing headband that guides wearers through meditation using changing weather sounds.
Rudick sees investor interest in mindfulness and meditation tools as an extension of the broader healthy living sector. Meditation, in particular, appears to be following a similar trajectory to that of yoga a decade or so earlier and is becoming popular with a much broader segment of the population.
From an investor perspective, yoga, fitness and healthy living deals have produced some nice returns and high valuation companies, too. Yoga apparel maker Lululemon, a former venture-backed startup that went public 10 years ago, is currently valued around $8 billion. In the unicorn space, Peloton, the company behind the spinning craze, closed its last round at a $1.25 billion valuation. (We’ve aggregated a few others here.)
There have been disappointments, as well. A recent case in point is YogaWorks, a private equity-backed yoga studio chain that has seen its stock price cut by nearly a third since its August IPO, which already debuted below the initial projected price.
Yet investors in the mindfulness space typically aren’t looking for just financial returns. Many, like Rudick, are so-called double bottom line investors, who look for companies that provide some social benefit in addition to profit potential.
Meditation and mindfulness practices are also popular in celebrity circles, which seems to have helped startups in the space secure funding from famous backers. Headspace’s investor lineup includes Ryan Seacrest, Jessica Alba and Jared Leto. Muse counts Ashton Kutcher as a backer. Thrive, meanwhile, is founded by well-known media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington.
Now, celebrity support won’t turn a laggard into a unicorn. But given how much time we spend with our devices binging on celebrity-studded content, perhaps we’d be wise to listen when these same celebrities gently suggest we take a few minutes to clear our minds.

In a pleasant Friday surprise, Roku dropped its S-1 document today, detailing its financial performance and corporate strategy.
The filing indicates that the company intends to raise $100 million in its debut. The figure is a widely-recognized placeholder number. The company could raise more or less in its IPO.
Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook
As a private company, Roku raised more than $200 million.
The firm, whose IPO was widely anticipated at a valuation around $1 billion, is set to test the market’s waters when indices trade near record highs, video reigns supreme in the media landscape, and some tech offerings have done well. Others have struggled.
Before the weekend impends, let’s slice through how Roku makes money, how much money it makes, and what to make of it all.
Roku sells TV-focused streaming hardware to consumers, and it also works with content players to get their material in front of consumers. It also has an ad business. The latter two efforts fall under what Roku calls “platform revenue.”
The company’s mix of top-line sources is described in its S-1 in the following fashion:
Over time, Roku has increased the percent of its total revenue that comes from its platform business. In practice, it looks like this (via Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research):

As we’ll see shortly, the mix shift in Roku’s revenue matters as one of the two sources has a far higher gross margin.
Driving the change, it seems, is that Roku drives more usage of its streaming service through partnered-hardware (TVs that run its software) instead of selling hardware over time. This means it can still drive new, active users and engaged hours while not being beholden to selling low-margin hardware.:


 
So Roku sells hardware for its streaming service, partners with TV manufacturers to sell Rock-powered hardware, drives revenue from partnered streaming companies, and sells ads.
Simple enough, really. How big is Roku? Let’s find out.
Before we dive into the guts of the company, here are the big numbers.
The following chart from Roku’s S-1 shows its 2016 and 2015 fiscal years, and the results of the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016 (calendar). Bear in mind that everything is in units of thousands, so a result of “$119,116” means $119,116,000. Let’s go:

The company’s revenue is expanding while its net losses fall thus far in 2017. The firm’s growth in the 2017 fiscal year came with slightly increased losses.
Roku grew 23 percent in the first two quarters of calendar 2017 compared to the year-ago period. That’s partially due to the company changing up how it brings in revenue. As such, the soft 23 percent figure is more nuanced than it might seem.
The above-mentioned revenue mix shift makes Roku’s revenue a bit harder to track than it otherwise might be. The firm posted sequential-quarter declines in hardware sales, for example, from the first quarter of this to the second. And, in the second quarter, the firm also posted year-over-year declines in hardware income.
Suffice it to say that the company’s hardware business is in decline. Its platform revenue has grown consistently, however. Going back a few quarters (calendar), here are its results:

As you can see, that is steady revenue growth from Roku’s platform business, aside from the slight Q4 to Q1 dip. Holiday quarters for companies that sell advertisements often see a decline in certain incomes after the close of the holiday-focused fourth quarter. The decline for Roku was modest and quickly offset by growth in the second quarter.
How investors will read that remains to be seen, but the firm has shown dramatic growth of its platform revenue—nearly 100 percent year-over-year.
More broadly, in the quarter ending June 30, 2017, Roku put up $99.62 million in revenue, less than its $100.09 million derived from its first quarter and under its fourth quarter result of $147.34 million. The company, despite its sequential-quarter declines, grew compared to its year-ago periods in each of the last four quarters.
If investors are willing to give more credence to Roku’s growing platform incomes as indicative of its corporate future, the sequential declines may not matter.
And why might investors care a bit more about Roku’s platform revenue than its hardware incomes? Because the company generates the vast bulk of its gross margin from its platform revenue. Turning once again to Dawson of Jackdaw, the following chart shows precisely how the platform business is more gross profit than the hardware business for Roku:

That’s sharp. What should we make of the above?
Roku must want out of the hardware business, at least as a leading revenue driver. It makes no money in that game. Notably, that makes it in a future-sense a nearly all-in OTT service that doesn’t generate its own content.
That isn’t a model that I would not have thought possible given the incredibly stiff arena of competition for content on the Internet today. Facebook is getting into a game that Netflix is pouring cash into, Amazon is playing, Apple is tinkering in the space, and Microsoft already picked up and dropped its video efforts.
I wonder if that fact might help Roku. It has distribution and content providers want access to audiences. That confluence could be, in part, why Roku’s ARPU is doing this:

That bodes well for the firm that, as we saw before, has a history of active user accretion. Quickly growing high-margin businesses are worth something after all.
What Roku is worth, however, is beyond me. With one revenue stream in decline, persistent losses, but big potential, the firm is going to be a fun one to price.

Katie Roof,Food,"It sounds like America’s favorite $400 juice machine will be no longer.
“After selling over a million Produce Packs, we must let you know that we are suspending the sale of the Juicero Press and Produce Packs immediately,” reads the company blog post.
Juicero will also be giving people money back. “For the next 90 days, we are offering refunds for your purchase of the Juicero Press,” according to the note.
Founded by Doug Evans, San Francisco-based Juicero had raised more than $118 million in funding from prominent VCs like Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Carmelo Anthony also invested through his Melo7 Tech venture fund. Even The Campbell Soup Company threw money at it. Juicero started raising funding in 2013 and launched 16 months ago.
The company was subject to mockery, particularly after a Bloomberg piece showed that the juice packets could be squeezed by hand and did not require a fancy machine. 
After that, Juicero promised to lower prices, but apparently found that to be too difficult. Now the startup is hoping to find a buyer.
“We are confident that to truly have the long-term impact we want to make, we need to focus on finding an acquirer with an existing national fresh food supply chain who can carry forward the Juicero mission,” reads the blog post.
Inspired by the popularity of Keurig coffee cups, some venture investors have been looking for other kitchen appliances that could gain significant traction. “Juicing” is very popular in some parts of the United States, and the idea was that this would make it easier for people to make juice at home. But the upfront cost of the machine was high and people had to pay an added cost for the refillable packets.
Unfortunately, the machine, which was once priced at $700, was met with derision from the get-go. It became symbolic of Silicon Valley’s out-of-touch elites.
