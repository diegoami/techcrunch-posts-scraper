Jon Russell,Asia,"It looks like Snap is enlisting outside help to advance its expansion into new hardware projects. The U.S. company is in talks with China-based drone maker Zero Zero Robotics over an acquisition, according to a source with knowledge of discussions.
The deal, which was first reported by The Information, is in the range of $150 million-$200 million, the source told TechCrunch. That price would represent quite an outlay, but Snap previously paid upwards of $250 million for social map company Zenly which is its most expensive acquisition to date. (Although Snap hasn’t confirmed its price for Zenly.)
Neither Snap nor Zero Zero Robotics had returned our requests for comment at the time of writing.
Zero Zero Robotics is best known for its Hover Camera drone, which is designed for taking aerial selfies and was on display at our TechCrunch China event in Shanghai last year. The device launched to the public in October, it is sold exclusively by Apple for $500 via both its online and physical retail stores.
When we first began to hear rumors that Zero Zero Robotics had been acquired by a “major U.S. company” earlier this summer, it was easy to assume that it had followed the fate of other drone companies in struggling to build a sustainable business and was seeking a soft landing. Most prominently, Lily, a Kickstarter success story, was forced to shutter earlier this year due to financial issues.
Snap does have a track record in shopping for bargains among defunct drone companies. The fact that Lily had held unsuccessful acquisition talks with Snap as an alternative to closing and that Snap reportedly did acquire drone firm Ctrl Me Robotics, which was about to shut down, played into that theory. While increased competition from drone pioneer DJI, which announced its own take on Hover Camera, the $499 Spark drone, may well have put some heat on the Hover Camera.
However, these negotiations are not driven by failure. Not only is Snap in talks to pay a lot more than the $25 million which Zero Zero Robotics has raised from investors to date, but, according to The Information, the Chinese company actually approached Snap over a potential investment — and that turned to a prospective acquisition.
For Snap, the deal makes sense as it looks to push its hardware business on from its Spectacles product. While another, more advanced iteration of the wearable camera glasses that could include augmented reality technology is currently under development, as TechCrunch recently reported, Snap has shown a desire to get into drones as part of its broadening focus on being a camera company.
Snap once looked into developing its own drones in house, according to a New York Times report, but in the end it looks to have opted to lean on specialists outside of the company.
Snap is under pressure from Wall Street to show growth, which could explain why it is prepared to pay a large sum to get a product that is already in the market. Its stock just came out of the dreaded lock-up period, when insiders are able to sell their shares, relatively unscathed, but its current value of $13.10 is well down on the $17 that it priced its IPO at in March.",2017-08-01,1522396,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hover-camera-passport-shown-off1.jpg?w=738,asia/,"snap,robot,music,drone",Snap is in talks to buy Chinese selfie drone maker Zero Zero Robotics for $150M-$200M,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/snap-is-in-talks-to-buy-chinese-selfie-drone-firm/
Fitz Tepper,Asia,"Last weekend Apple removed all major VPN apps from the App Store in China. In a statement the next day provided to TechCrunch, it explained that China requires all VPN developers to have a license issued by the government, and they’ve been required to remove some VPN apps in China that don’t meet the new regulations.
The three sentence statement didn’t really go into depth on the situation, but today on the company’s earnings call Apple CEO Tim Cook gave a much more detailed explanation of the move and Apple’s perspective on dealing with regulatory issues related to China (and other governments).
Here’s the full statement:
Cook’s comments suggest that this particular issue may not have been big enough for Apple to pick a fight over. Because while Cook does note that they’d rather not remove the apps, and Apple believes in engaging with governments when they disagree, the company didn’t take any direct action this time, at least in the form of a lawsuit or formal complaint.
However, Cook did emphasize that in this situation the law is on China’s side, unlike the FBI iPhone unlocking saga last year where Cook reiterated that the law supported them.",2017-08-01,1522210,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/apple-china.jpg?w=738,asia/,"vpn,finance,earnings",Here’s Tim Cook’s explanation on why some VPN apps were pulled in China,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/heres-tim-cooks-explanation-on-why-some-vpn-apps-were-pulled-in-china/
Fitz Tepper,Asia,"Apple had a pretty good quarter — the stock just jumped 4 percent after hours on $45.4 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $1.67.
But there’s one dark spot in the company’s results — and that’s performance in Greater China.
Apple took in just over $8 billion in revenue from Greater China this quarter, which is less than half of what it made there two years ago in Q2 2015. It’s also a 10 percent decline year-over-year and a 25 percent decline from last quarter. To compare, revenue generated in the Americas was up 13 percent year-over-year, and down only 4 percent from last quarter.
Greater China is also the only region that saw negative growth year-over-year.

At least Apple seems to be aware of, and working on, the issue. A few weeks ago the company appointed its first-ever managing director of Greater China, who will report directly to CEO Tim Cook and COO Jeff Williams.
China was once a bright spot for Apple, and the fastest-growing region for the company. Q2 2015 saw $16.8 billion in revenue from China. Two years later, the company is now making less than half of that.
On the earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained that Hong Kong continues to drag down revenue for all of Greater China, and what they see from the mainland is more encouraging. Cook also said he thinks the popularity of WeChat and other messaging services is a good thing and makes it easier for potential new customers to switch to iOS, because the platform works on iPhone and users’ old phones.",2017-08-01,1522134,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/apple-china.png?w=738,asia/,"greater-china,china",Apple continues to struggle in China as revenue drops 10%,"tim-cook,apple",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/apple-continues-to-struggle-in-china-as-revenue-drops-10/
Jon Russell,Apps,"Uber just got itself another potential thorn in its side in Southeast Asia, where its closest rival Grab just raised $2 billion in fresh capital, after an unlikely source announced plans to enter Thailand’s ride-hailing space.
Line, the Japanese company best known for its messaging app — and cutesy animal stickers — this week announced that it will offer a licensed taxi booking service to its users in Thai capital Bangkok. The service is set to launch before the end of this year.
Line has offered taxis in its homeland for two years, but it said that this new service is part of an expansion of Line’s year-old on-demand services platform, ‘Line Man,’ which currently spans food delivery, messenger/postal services, and more. Line is Thailand’s dominant chat app — the country is one of Line’s four largest markets in terms of users — and that’s undoubtedly why it is expanding into car bookings there before any other part of Southeast Asia.
Uber is under pressure to catch up with Grab across the region, and upstart Go-Jek in Indonesia, so a potentially popular new addition like Line isn’t exactly good news.
Line Thailand said its new service was “developed in compliance with the Department of Land and Transport (DLT)’s regulations and Thai laws” — the legal status of Uber and Grab is somewhat grey in Thailand — which means that the service will work with licensed taxis. It has roped in the Bangkok Taxi Co-operative Network, which claims 60 percent of Bangkok’s 100,000 taxis as members.

For Line, this marks another move to diversify its business and widen its appeal to users. The company went public in a $1.1 billion US-Japan IPO last year, and most of its revenue is derived from its advertising business and in-app purchases within its social gaming apps. Line has introduced a series of services, such as mobile payment, video and music services and more, to widen its capacity to generate revenue, but it also bidding to become a ‘lifestyle platform’ for its users.
That means that Line wants to develop a value that locks users in beyond chat. As I wrote last year, Facebook Messenger’s continued growth in Asia should worry Line. Indeed, the company pulled back on ambitious plans to grow its userbase in Western markets in favor of doubling down on Asia, but already there are warning signs. Line’s latest financial showed that the company is losing users in its four major markets for the first time, even though its overall revenue is growing.",2017-08-01,1521861,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bangkok-taxi.jpg?w=738,asia/,"business,mobile-software,car-sharing,transport",Chat app Line is launching a taxi-booking service to rival Uber in Thailand,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/line-taxi-booking-service-thailand/
Jon Russell,Asia,"We’re just weeks away from Samsung’s next major launch event on August 23, and already we have a full visual of the device it is expected to unveil — the Galaxy Note 8.
That’s courtesy of prolific smartphone leaker Evan Blass — who correctly detailed Samsung’s Galaxy S8 before it was announced earlier this year — and a couple of photos of the apparently upcoming phone that he posted on Twitter. We don’t have precise specs at this point, but we can deduce a few things from the top image beyond the dual-camera-dual-flash array on the reverse. It looks like the Note 8 will sport a fingerprint scanner on its backside next to the camera, like the Galaxy S8 — where it is fairly awkward — while it appears it will also borrow the S8’s Bixby button on its right side.
Another thing we know is that the Note 8 is likely to be the largest Note yet.
That’s not simply going on these leaked screenshots. Samsung dropped a major hint with its event invitation — ‘Do bigger things’ — while previous leaks have hinted at a 6.3-inch, 19.5:9 aspect ratio display which would really be something. Samsung has a lot at stake with this device, of course, given the recall of last year’s Note 7 due to battery issues that, in some cases, caused explosions.
Screens are a hot battle-ground for this year’s smartphone show ponies. LG is said to be prepping an AMOLED screen for its next flagship, Huawei’s CEO confirmed its upcoming Mate 10 will have a full-screen display, and there’s the 10 year edition iPhone, which looks like it will pack a lot of new features, including infra-red face unlock and an (apparent) bezel-less front screen.",2017-08-01,1521790,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/dgijd4zxgaai8ni.jpg?w=738,asia/,"tablet-computers,manufacturing,samsung-galaxy,technology",Here’s an early look at the Samsung Galaxy Note 8,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/samsung-note-8-leaked-image/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing company that forced Uber out of China, has expanded its increasingly global empire after it made an investment in Taxify, an Uber-like service that operates in Europe and Africa as it prepares to launch in London later this year.
The amount invested has not been disclosed but TechCrunch understands from a source close to the deal that it is an eight-figure U.S. dollar sum. We are trying to get a more specific number.
Four-year-old Taxify is headquartered in Estonia — three of its founders are ex-Skype — and today it operates in 18 countries, including Hungary, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. While much of its business has been in emerging markets, the company is planning for an expansion to London later this year. Taxify claims 2.5 million users and its services span private cars and licensed taxis, which puts it squarely into the ‘Uber Rival’ box.
That’s a cause that Didi knows well — and is prone to putting money towards helping.
Aside from buying Uber China’s business to consolidate its dominant position at home, Didi has expanded its network with a series of global expansion partnerships. In addition to high-profile investments in Lyft, India’s Ola and Grab in Southeast Asia — the latter of which just landed $2 billion from Didi and SoftBank — it is in South America via a $100 million investment in Brazil’s 99.
Now we can add Europe to that list because, interestingly, Didi hadn’t backed an Uber rival in the region until this news.
Didi CEO Cheng Wei said that the investment, which includes a strategic partnership, will help link up transport services in Asia with those in Europe and Africa. Didi, which claims 400 million users across a variety of services in China, said it will help Taxify to grow its presence in its regions — where it claims to be second to Uber — and to develop smarter products.
The alliance will certainly be a boost since, unlike most others in the subsidization-heavy ride-hailing space, Taxify has raised a relative modest €2 million ($2.4 million) from investors to date. That’s likely to change now it has the world’s second-highest valued private tech company in its corner.",2017-08-01,1521783,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/taxify.png?w=738,asia/,"economy,transport,business","China’s Didi invests in Taxify, an Uber rival operating in Europe and Africa",uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/chinas-didi-invests-in-taxify/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Less than a week after the SEC said that it may regulate certain crypto token sales, better known as ICOs, Singapore has followed suit to say it too will regulate offerings that are deemed to be securities.
Already a global financial hub, Singapore has developed into a destination of sorts for ICOs, with the likes of TenX ($80 million), Golem ($8.6 million) and Qtum ($15.6 million) among those to have held ICOs from the country. In an era of uncertainty around the way traditional financial regulators will deal with the burst in alternative funding via ICOs, Singapore’s central bank’s move to tokenized its currency was seen as a positive validation by many in the crypto industry.
Indeed, some consider Singapore to be an ‘ICO Haven’ — a Wired story in March stated that local regulators “do not consider this kind of digital token to be a security.”
Well, that’s not quite true, it turns out. Today the MAS, Monetary Authority of Singapore, published a note to inform that it will regulate some (but seemingly not all) ICOs.
The takeaway from the six point bulletin is that MAS will regulate an ICO offering if it looks like a product that falls into Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act, i.e. if it behaves like a stock or any other security. MAS will also regulate exchanges and other services that enable post-ICO coin trading, the note said.
It all sounds simple enough, but the judge of what constitutes a ‘security’ is down to the regulator itself, and at this point it isn’t clear exactly what the considerations are.
The most pertinent piece of advice from MAS is an obvious one. Any company or individual considering an ICO that involves Singapore should “seek independent legal advice to ensure they comply with all applicable laws, and consult MAS where appropriate.”
Beyond running an ICO for a business that is located in Singapore, MAS could also take interest in ICOs that accept money from buyers who are Singaporean or those who are based in the country.
So, far from doom and gloom, Singapore’s financial regulator has come out with an acknowledgement of the rise of ICOs in its domain and, by saying it will regulate certain offerings, it has eased some uncertainties around the legal status of this fast-growing fundraising option. Now we’ll have to wait to see which, or indeed whether any, upcoming ICOs fall into its securities basket and how they are dealt with.
Already the MAS disclosure has been welcomed by one industry body, ACCESS, which is comprised of representatives from Singapore’s cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.
“ACCESS welcomes today’s statement from MAS. They recognize the wide variety of digital tokens available and that not all fall under the remit of the SFA. We appreciate their clarification and reiteration of their position on virtual currencies,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
MAS previously issued advice on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which is used for ICOs, but it released this new note in response to the way crypto has evolved into a mechanism for raising funding.
“MAS’ position of not regulating virtual currencies is similar to that of most jurisdictions. However, MAS has observed that the function of digital tokens has evolved beyond just being a virtual currency. For example, digital tokens may represent ownership or a security interest over an issuer’s assets or property,” it wrote.",2017-07-31,1521739,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/shutterstock_244507771.jpg?w=738,asia/,"finance,token,security","Singapore, like the US, says it may regulate some ICOs",crowdfunding,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/singapore-ico-regulation/
Jon Russell,Asia,"What a difference a week makes. Less than seven days after Flipkart’s much-rumored acquisition of Snapdeal appeared to be nearing completion following months of speculation, the deal has officially died.
All that stood between a reported $900-$950 million acquisition was the approval of Snapdeal’s board, but now talks are over and Snapdeal will continue on as an independent company. Rumors of a coming-together began in April.
“Snapdeal has been exploring strategic options over the last several months. The company has now decided to pursue an independent path and is terminating all strategic discussions as a result,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
The company will not shop itself to rival Flipkart — which is seeking a boost in its efforts to battle Amazon — but it has agreed to trade its Freecharge payment business, bought for just shy of $500 million in 2015, to Axis Bank for a bargain price of $60 million. Snapdeal, which was valued as high as $6.5 billion in 2015, said in a statement that the sale and other cost-cutting measures will make the company “financially self-sustainable” again.
“Snapdeal’s vision has always been to create life-changing experiences for millions of buyers and sellers across India. We have a new and compelling direction — Snapdeal 2.0 — that uniquely furthers this vision, and have made significant progress towards the ability to execute this by achieving a gross profit this month,” it added.
The death of the deal appears to have been down to opposite early Snapdeal investors Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, according to a Reuters report. According to the publication, roadblocks put up by Snapdeal killed negotiations. Founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal ultimately opted to remain independent and, with the backing of the two investors, are looking running a “stripped down” version of the service. That’s likely to mean more layoffs for Snapdeal’s 1,000-plus staff. The company let 500-600 employees go in a cost-cutting move made in February.
SoftBank and Tiger Global, two major Snapdeal backers, were reportedly particularly keen on the Flipkart-Snapdeal alignment as it would get them equity in Flipkart, which has emerged as Amazon’s biggest e-commerce competitor. Flipkart, which has battled slowing growth and C-level changes over the past few years, appointed new CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy in January and then went on to raise $1.4 billion in funding from eBay, Microsoft and Tencent in April at a valuation of $11.6 billion.",2017-07-31,1521203,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/photo-31-07-2017-6-12-58-pm.jpg?w=738,asia/,"nexus-venture-partners,business,e-commerce,snapdeal",Flipkart’s on-off-on-off-on-off deal to acquire Snapdeal is now officially dead,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/flipkart-flipdeal-snapdeal-snapdead/
Jon Russell,Asia,"SAIF Partners, one of India’s most active investment firms, has returned with a new fund of $350 million, its sixth to date.
Unlike other firms, SAIF opted to keep its newest fund at the same size as its previous one because it allows it to be selective on deals, a number of partners told TechCrunch in an interview. SAIF has more than $4 billion in assets under management. Its portfolio includes U.S. IPO exits from Make My Trip and Just Dial and stakes in promising private firms like Paytm, Alibaba’s India proxy, and food delivery service Swiggy.
The fund is unlikely to be put into action for another three to four months, that’s the time when the firm anticipates that it will have finished deploying capital from its current fund.
As for the focus, that’s really much the same as before, SAIF Partners managing director Alok Goel told TechCrunch. In particular logistics, fintech and content are primary areas of interest, while Goel said that enterprise Saas businesses and hardware/internet-of-things are segments where the firm would like to “do more” with the new fund.
SAIF Partners plans to deploy the fund across a range of stages, including seed deals, Series A and later growth rounds, too, as it has done with past funds.
The firm is optimistic that a funding lull that struck India in 2015 and 2016 has been replaced by an environment in which strong companies, at early and late stages of development, have emerged.
“Late stage funding in the county had become stark in 2016, but more encouraging signs now this year,” Goel said. “Clear category leaders have emerged and justified or gone beyond valuations — that’s another encouraging trend. The number of new company deal flow had gone down in 2016, but we’re seeing that the trend is moving in terms of the quality of companies we are meeting.”
Supply of cash is also opening up in India, too, even if larger investors like Tiger Global and SoftBank have pulled back somewhat after massive spending sprees over the past two years.
Accel raised a new $450 million India fund last November, while Sequoia quietly closed $4 billion in fresh funds part of which is set to be mobilized in India.

John Mannes,Finance,"An SEC filing turned up this morning showing that Product Hunt’s Ryan Hoover is investing out of a $3 million AngelList Angel Fund going by the name Weekend Fund. We previously reported that Hoover was a deal lead through the Angel Funds product — but now we know the size and name of the vehicle.
Today’s news, first reported by Axios, could indicate that Hoover is planning on getting more serious about investing in startups. His startup, Product Hunt, a site for discovering products, was acquired by AngelList in December 2016 for $20 million. Since then, AngelList has been doubling down on creating tools to help small investors.
Building on previous work with AngelList Syndicates, Angel Funds offers investors access to their own venture capital fund. Through the program, fund managers typically receive between $500,000 and $1 million to invest — though outside limited partners can contribute beyond that amount. AngelList then collects between 2.5 and 5 percent of profits while managers take home around 15 percent.
It’s not clear at this point how much of the capital Hoover raised came from outside backers. Typical first-time fund managers, raising from traditional limited partners, often aim to start with around $10 million. Axios notes that Hoover has already started meeting with founders.

Natasha Lomas,Apps,"It may well turn out, as technologists are already suspecting, that AI makes everything better. But plenty of startup founders are still in the experimental phase of figuring out whether — or maybe how much  — machine learning can improve an existing app category.
The label that will probably end up being prefixed here is ‘smart’. Here’s one example: FitGenie, an iOS app whose ex-Georgia Tech co-founders bill it as a “smart calorie counter” — on account of applying machine learning algorithms to simplify nutrition planning for people wanting to achieve a certain weight or fitness goal.
“Our self-adjusting diet algorithm is based on a model we created that maps and forecasts the progress of an individual user and makes intelligent weekly adjustments based on the data we gather,” says co-founder Keith Osayande, explaining how it’s applying AI to calorie counting.
“This model is based on both [original co-founders’] our combined experiences as nutrition coaches and the most current scientific evidence we have available. Rather than just create a simple calorie calculator, we also process all of your data and take all aspects of dieting into account including, body composition, adherence, weight change rate trends, hunger, fatigue, and a handful of other metrics.”
“The key thing to note is that we are not just gathering this data. Our algorithm is constantly assessing how these data points trend with each other and making informed adjustments,” he adds.
Now it’s worth emphasizing that FitGenie’s app is still at an early stage, with the bootstrapping team starting work on their idea in fall 2015, when they were still students at Georgia Tech, and touting an impending 3.0 update — coming in the next “one to two months” — that aims to improve the polish and usability of their freemium offering.
Last year the team took in $20,000 in funding from the Georgia Tech Create-X Startup Summer Program, and they now have some 21,000 users, a year after launch — generating early revenue from those choosing to pay the subscription to access premium features.
“Currently… we’re focusing on the nutritional aspect of people’s journey into fitness,” says Osayande. “So it’s mainly focused on helping people lose weight, gain muscle mass or kind of maintain their current body with whatever physical activities that they’re doing.”
Though he also notes there are obvious opportunities to integrate with fitness trackers down to line to automatically pull in relevant fitness data (vs asking people to manually input physical activity as the app currently does).
FitGenie is aiming to stand out in a crowded space through “simplicity and automation”, says Osayande. So really its idea is that AI will be able to help users adhere to a diet and stay on track with their fitness goals by acting as a de facto pocket nutrition coach.
“A lot of the [existing calorie counting] apps, they take in your data and they just give you graphs or pictures to look at — but they don’t do anything with your data,” he argues. “And that put a lot of strain on the user to actually have to understand their data and make adjustments on their own. But most people don’t have the training to do that and quite frankly don’t have the time or energy to put the effort in to learn that stuff — so we wanted to pretty much do all that for people.”
“The top counters in the market are cluttered, ad-heavy, and difficult to use,” he continues. “Our algorithms emulate the major functions of a personal nutritionist to eliminate much of this guesswork, thus making dieting simpler and less time consuming.
“So [users] can just enter their data, they don’t have to understand it, they don’t have to really know what they’re entering — just put what you’re eating, put your weight and then FitGenie does all the number crunching for you.”
Users of FitGenie do need to do some leg work, however — including inputting their current weight (ideally weekly), and logging the foods they’re eating and any activity they undertake (ideally doing so at least twice per week, says Osayande; more being better).
The app then generates custom daily nutrition targets, based on whatever a user’s desired fitness goal is — such as losing weight, building lean muscle and so on.
“All of that is done by an [AI] model that we created in-house based off of [co-founder and chief adviser] Eric Helms’ research and then testing the algorithm when we were at Georgia Tech when we were at the barbell club,” he adds.
The paid version of the app include additional features, such as meal planning — with FitGenie currently drawing on a database of five million foods to generate its suggestions.
Here it’s applying a genetic algorithm to “create an optimal meal plan that meets the user’s nutrition targets as well as their [dietary] preferences”, as Osayande put it.
Although he also concedes that, currently, the app’s food database skews towards the co-founders own nutritional expertise — which means its assumption is users are meat eaters. So the team has a fair bit of work to do building out the database to ensure the meal planning feature can support users who are vegan or vegetarian, for instance, or who are trying to stick to a specific meat-eating diet such as paleo.
Another feature of the app aims to simplify sticking to a nutrition plan by keeping track of particular foodstuffs users have to hand, via a virtual in-app pantry, with the algorithm then adjusting its meal suggestions to take account of what they do or don’t have in the cupboard.
At this (still early) stage it’s fair to say there’s a lot more potential than perfect execution here — even as the team works on the touted polish coming down the pipe with v3.0.
One area where it can spectacularly fail to alleviate nutrition-related tedium right now is in its approach to food logging — with an over-reliance on scanning barcodes to log what you’re eating.
So while that might work fine if you’re always eating US pre-packaged meals and foodstuffs, anyone who falls outside that — say people who prefer to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients, or users outside the US — will find they have to manually create food items in the app, including inputting exact levels of nutrients (grams of protein, carbs, fat etc).
This gets very tedious very fast, with apparently no ability to search and select basic foodstuffs from a database to add their nutrient info. (Though there is at least a ‘quick add’ option which lets you create a food and just add a handful of the core nutrients vs the extensive list you have to fill in if you select to ‘create food’).
Finding a way to improve or automate food logging would make for a much more compelling proposition. And indeed Osayande says the team is working on some ideas using either smartphone photos and even potentially Apple’s ARKit to automate this in a future version.
“That’s still a little ways out and we’re still developing to see if we can either take pictures or scan people’s food to measure it that way — but we just got our hands on ARKit so we’re looking into that to see if that’s a possibility,” he adds.
In terms of rivals, existing players in the calorie counting space include apps like MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, LoseIt and Noom but Osayande names the closest competitor as another AI-applying automatic meal planner — called Eat This Much.

Jordan Crook,Apps,"As Rafiki once said, “It is time.”
Tinder Gold, the dating app’s new premium subscription tier (which includes a feature that lets you see who’s already liked you without any swiping) is finally rolling out to the U.S.
Tinder Gold and Likes You were originally tested in Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico at the end of June. Today, however, the the feature rolls out to all Tinder users across the globe.
One of Tinder’s greatest obstacles has always been balancing the game of Tinder with the utility of Tinder. Those who were actually looking for a romantic endeavor were often inundated with matches that were simply swiping for the sake of swiping. In fact, before Likes You, the only way Tinder users had access to everyone that liked them was to swipe right on everyone.
Tinder’s Right Swipe Limiter worked well to curb that, but Likes You is a great way to make some cash on the back’s of users’ insatiable curiosity.
The company says that more than 1.6 billion swipes go down on Tinder each day around the world.
“Some users have a lot of time to spend swiping and connecting with new people, but we’ve found that others want to maximize the time they’re able to spend on the app, and Likes You gives those users a way to swipe, match, and start chatting seamlessly,” said Tinder Chief Product Officer Brian Norgard. “Tinder Gold provides subscribers with the fun and engaging swiping experience they love about Tinder, coupled with the efficiency and control of being able to see who’s swiped right on them first.”
Tinder Gold includes many of the Tinder Plus features, such as Passport, Rewind, Unlimited Likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and other profile controls. And you can’t forget Likes You.
Tinder Gold pricing is still being tested, but the current price is $4.99/month. The company told Buzzfeed that, during testing in other countries, your average Tinder Gold user received around 60 percent more matches compared to free Tinder users.",2017-08-29,1532912,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/tindermatch.jpeg?w=738,startups/,tinder-gold,"Tinder Gold, which lets you see who has liked you, launches today in U.S.",tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/tinder-gold-which-lets-you-see-who-has-liked-you-launches-today-in-u-s/
Anthony Ha,Media,"We get a lot of weed-related pitches at TechCrunch, but most of them don’t come with the pedigree of Herb‘s investors.
Herb is announcing today that it has raised $4.1 million in seed funding led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures, with participation from Slow Ventures, Buddy Media co-founder Michael Lazerow, Bullpen Capital, Shiva Rajarama, Liquid 2 Ventures (the firm led by football legend Joe Montana), Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, Shopify COO Harley Finkelstein and Adam Zeplain.
“During our research into the cannabis industry, it became clear to both myself and our team at Liquid 2 Ventures that HERB was the most professionally run business for relevant, informative, cannabis content,” Montana said in the funding announcement.
Herb’s articles and videos cover the latest cannabis-related news,  with plenty of how-to and educational content. The site started as something called The Stoner’s Cookbook before it was acquired and rebranded by Gray in 2015. Since then, the company has grown to 200 million video views per month, reaching 5.3 million unique viewers, according to Tubular Labs.
And while Herb currently looks like a digital media business, Gray said, “We don’t see ourselves as just a website. We were always setting out to build a technology platform.”
Eventually, he wants Herb to become a site that you can visit for “everything cannabis-related,” including buying weed from local businesses and getting it delivered to your home in just a few minutes.
Gray compared the company to Uber and Airbnb, both in the sense that they’re an intermediary between consumers and service providers, and because they’ve had to fight some big legal battles along the way. He said Herb will respect local laws around cannabis sales, but at the same time, “I think these laws are changing — it’s about time. And as they change, Herb wants to be right there.”
To be clear, Herb is still a ways off from launching a marketplace business, but Gray said the site is adding new features that bring it closer to that goal, like creating detailed profiles of local dispensaries.
“There’s a very real stigma that exists around cannabis today and our viewpoint on things here at Herb is that yesterday’s social stigmas become tomorrow’s social norms,” he added. “We’re trying to present the best face that we can for this industry and bring cannabis into the mainstream.”",2017-08-29,1532661,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/shutterstock_267854009.jpg?w=738,startups/,"cannabis,marijuana,lerer-hippeau-ventures",Cannabis website Herb raises $4.1M,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/herb-seed-funding/
Josh Constine,Artificial Intelligence,"Gigster is shifting from letting anyone outsource full-stack app development to building next-gen tech projects for big companies. If an enterprise needs machine learning and vision, data visualization, blockchain, React or Swift work done and doesn’t want to hire full-time employees, Gigster assembles a squad of freelancers and guarantees the work at a fixed price.
With software eating everything, talent in high demand and tech rock stars seeking flexible schedules, Gigster is at the intersection of several massive trends. That’s why Redpoint is leading Gigster’s $20 million Series B joined by previous investor Andreessen Horowitz, and basketball legend Michael Jordan making one of his first tech investments. That brings the Gigster rocketship to $32.5 million in total funding just two years after launch.
“Since the invention of computers, new technologies have made programming languages exponentially higher level,” Gigster co-founder Roger Dickey tells me. “These shifts, combined with the ‘future of work’ accelerants such as freelancing and AI, have changed software engineering dramatically and will continue to do so.”

When Gigster raised its 2016 Series A, it had just three enterprise clients. Since then it’s scaled up to more than 40, with project size up 10X and revenue up 3.5X to the double-digit millions per year. That’s because enterprises can afford to shell out the big bucks for high-quality development. When budgets are tight with small-to-medium sized businesses, “we’re able to do a good job for the client, but not always as good as the client wants. It’s a bit of a mismatch,” co-founder Roger Dickey explains. “With enterprises, our satisfaction has been off the charts.” Revenue is up 2.5X year-over-year.
Gigster works with more than 1,000 top-of-the-line freelancers sourced from Stanford, MIT, Facebook and Google. They can earn bonuses through the Gigster Fund that pays freelancers part of the returns if projects it invests in successfully exit.
Gigster claims to have 93 percent client satisfaction, with 94 percent of projects within budget and 96 percent of milestones hit on schedule. Clients include Pepsi, Wyndam Hotels and MasterCard, as well as eBay, Square and OpenTable. They could struggle to recruit, or let Gigster take care of it. The startup plans to triple in size by hiring 120 more employees with the new funding.

At its core, Gigster is fusing teams of freelancers with advanced project management tools and artificial intelligence to ensure gigs get done on time and on budget. That’s a rarity in the tech world, where the joke is that you should double any estimate you’re given about how long it will take to design and code something.
The frustration of finding gifted but reliable freelancers is what led Dickey to found Gigster. After building hit social game Dope Wars, selling it to Zynga where it was turned into Mafia Wars and working there a few years, he wanted to experiment with some new projects. He started Gigster with co-founder Debo Olaosebikan to make it easy for anyone to pay to get software designed, coded and delivered. It competes with traditional hiring and freelance marketplaces like Toptal, where clients have to manage projects themselves, with Gigster emphasizing its turn-key service.

To fuel the enterprise pivot, Gigster raised the $20 million Series B from Redpoint, Andreessen and Jordan, as well as Y Combinator, Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Marc Benioff and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. Dickey wouldn’t disclose the valuation but said “it was a substantial up round and we’re very pleased with the outcome.” Does Air Jordan bring any special skills to the cap table? Nope. “He was my childhood hero. It’s just fun to have him on the cap table,” Dickey laughs. “He didn’t put a ton into the round. We thought it’d be cool to have someone involved that we really look up to.”
Gigster already has luminary operators behind it, and chose Redpoint to lead the round because it’s a software-as-a-service expert. “We’re thinking of moving towards a SaaS model,” Dickey reveals. “It’s not going to happen immediately after the B round, but on top of selling [freelance development] services, we may sell some SaaS-based products as well.” He was cagey about what exactly those products would be, but they’d likely let enterprises use some of Gigster’s internal scoping and efficiency tools on their in-house projects.
“There’s a new model in consulting, combining freelance talent with automation tools. That’s the reason Gigster exists,” Dickey tells me. “I think now is the right time to start this company as there’s structured data on work. Companies are leaving data in Asana, Trello, Slack . . . they’re leaving digital footprints. Our platform sucks out that structured data.”

For example, Gigster has mapped out 1,000 past projects to build a calculator that automatically processes time and budget proposals for potential clients. Its “Supervisor” tool knows how code check-ins and communication between engineers and the project manager should ramp up as a deadline approaches. “If you don’t see those actions happening, there’s a 91 percent chance you’re going to miss the milestone date,” Dickey says, which lets Gigster know when to step in to nudge freelancers or make changes.
These tools and more like its Team Builder, PM Assistant and Code Librarian could be invaluable to companies working on lots of projects, and give Gigster a SaaS-subscription revenue stream where it doesn’t have to pay out a big chunk to its freelancer teams. With all its new cash, Gigster can pay to build more SaaS tools, buy sales people to hock them and its freelancing service and add more fulfillment staff to the 15-person team that ensures gigs get done within the guaranteed schedule and budget.
Not every company will be able to adapt to the software revolution on their own. And with advanced technologies like AI, blockchain and new mobile frameworks becoming more essential amidst a talent shortage, enterprises will need help. Gigster has a mercenary army at the ready.",2017-08-29,1531999,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/gigster-fund.jpg?w=738,startups/,"redpoint-ventures,freelance,gigster",Michael Jordan funds mercenary dev hub Gigster’s $20M enterprise pivot,andreessen-horowitz,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/gigster/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"There are an increasing number of startups trying to bring more transparency — and, dare I say it, disruption — to various element of sea freight or the shipping industry. These include Freightos, the well-funded freight marketplace and freight-forwarding quote price comparison site, and, more recently, Shipamax, which is trying to drag bulk shipping into the digital age.
Now we can add BunkerEx to the list, a newly funded startup out of London that is building an online marketplace to change the way shipping companies buy fuel, or ‘bunkers,’ to use the correct industry term. In what is being described as a “pre-seed” round, the company has raised £400,000 from early-stage investor Seedcamp, and the taxpayer-funded London Co-Investment Fund, along with a number of unnamed angel investors.
“I’ve been in the oil and shipping industry for nearly ten years now, most recently working four years at the largest bunker trader in the world,” BunkerEx co-founder and CEO Ishaan Hemnani tells TechCrunch. “That’s really where I learnt the ropes of this opaque industry and saw first-hand how a lack of transparency was significantly costing shipping companies”.
To put into context how opaque the buying and selling of bunkers is, Hemnani says that currently most shipping companies go to brokers to buy fuel for their ships in the same way you might use a mortgage or insurance broker, but with a key difference: the bunker market is entirely unregulated.
The result is that “brokers don’t choose vendors objectively but instead based on their own relationships,” meaning that although brokers should be acting in the interest of buyers (i.e. the shipping companies), they often give them a higher price in order to increase commissions.
“Shipping companies never see the conversations between their broker and the supplier, and this ultimately costs them,” he says.
To address this, BunkerEx operates an online marketplace that matches supply and demand in a more direct way, bypassing traditional bunker brokers, even if in some says it also resembles one itself (the startup’s website even uses the tagline “The world’s most transparent bunker broker”).
Explains Hemnani: “We’ve built a marketplace where buyers post their request on the site, and based on several parameters, such as the port, dates and fuel type, we show them a full list of our verified suppliers. They can then send the request to all suppliers in one click, who get invited into a live auction to openly compete for the deal. It’s like Alibaba for bunker fuel!”.
All offers are then transmitted in real-time, and once the buyer sees an offer they like, they accept it and the auction for that request ends. Noteworthy, suppliers are kept anonymous to each other and buyers can also give a counter price to all suppliers at once as leverage on a first to accept wins basis.
“Besides the monetary benefits, there’s also a huge amount of time saved as a buyer can reach out to a large number of suppliers and fix a deal in minutes,” adds the BunkerEx CEO. “Traditionally this is all done over instant messenger (such as Skype Chat, although it used to be Yahoo! Messenger) so there is a lot of back-and-forth on different chat windows. We estimate that our platform saves a buyer an average of 40 minutes per deal”.
Meanwhile, I’m told that a total of 400 million tonnes of fuel is delivered to ships every year, so BunkerEx is going after a potentially huge market. Repeat business shouldn’t be an issue either, with shippers typically needing to refuel vessels several times per week.
And despite going up against traditional bunker brokers, Hemnani explains that BunkerEx hasn’t ditched an important element of what they offer, which is ensuring the quality and reliability of fuel suppliers. “Ultimately fuel is pumped onto a ship and a lot can go wrong with the delivery, so we still employ experts who are on call for our clients 24/7 to deal with any issues. That way we offer shipping companies all the benefits of using a broker, without having to pay the price for it,” he says.
To that end, BunkerEx says it charges a fixed commission to the supplier but doesn’t charge the buyer anything. Furthermore, that commission is said to be 80 per cent less than the fee a traditional bunker broker takes, with these savings returned back to the buyer. “Keep in mind that fuel makes up approximately 70 per cent of the cost of a voyage, so there’s a large incentive to reduce these costs,” adds Hemnani.",2017-08-29,1532184,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-600101128.jpg?w=738,startups/,,BunkerEx is an online marketplace for shipping companies that need to buy fuel,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunkerex/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Bunch, a newly-launched startup operating out of Berlin, is aiming to be something akin to a “Google Analytics for company culture”. It offers a SaaS to let companies and company teams quantify internal company culture, and then use this data as the basis to screen job candidates to help ensure that they will also be a good fit.
Specifically, by mapping company culture data against that provided by a job applicant, the idea, Bunch founder and CEO Darja Gutnick tells me, is to be able to highlight any potential cultural fit issues that can be teased out during a subsequent interview. The software itself is based on the “organizational culture diagnosis” model developed by Charles O’Reilly from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
Gutnick says that during her time as a researcher and consultant for “high-growth startups”, she realized that a strong company culture is at the core of every successful team. However, creating the right company culture starts with hiring the right people, but it is a challenge for many companies to figure out who really is a fit for their team. Evaluating candidates based on a CV and numerous rounds of interviews alone just doesn’t cut it.
The way Bunch works is as follows: A company signs to the Saas and its teams take a 5-minute culture assessment, based on the O’Reilly model. Then, using the data provided, Bunch creates a culture profile for the company and each of its teams, mapped onto 6 key dimensions: Results-orientation, Adaptability, Collaborative, Detail-orientation, Principles and Customer-orientation. Every new applicant is tasked with taking an automated culture quiz that Bunch checks against the team and company profile.
Using the resulting Bunch report, which details the candidate’s “behavioral tendencies” as well their potential fit with the company, the premise is that hiring managers can make more informed decisions but also use any conflicts as a jumping off point during a subsequent interview to really drill down into how well they integrate or what cultural value they could in fact add.
For example, someone very detailed oriented and rigid might not seem a fit for a fast-moving super early startup, but actually, within a particular team and by being aware of and talking through the potential conflict at interview, it could be the exact attribute a team needs. Or so the thinking goes.
Put differently, Gutnick frames it as shifting the focus away from a candidate’s professional past and towards his/her present state of mind, team fit and work attitudes that impact present and future performance.
“Team diversity in background, education and demographics is helpful and necessary, but when it comes to beliefs and attitudes, alignment is a key success factor resulting in 5x more annual revenue as opposed to companies that are not aligned. By measuring cultural alignment utilising multiple machine learning components, Bunch provides a solution that helps companies select candidates that fit the team, shape their culture early on when hiring and drive its success,” she says.",2017-08-29,1532350,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/darja_gutnick_bunch.jpg?w=738,startups/,google-analytics,Bunch wants to be ‘Google Analytics for company culture’,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunch-ai/
Matt Burns,Cloud,"Western Digital has today announced that it purchased Upthere for an undisclosed amount. Upthere had previously raised $77 million from an impressive list of investors, with KPCB and Western Digital Ventures leading the round, along with Floodgate, Elevation Partners, GV, NTT Docomo Ventures and Square 1 Bank.
Upthere wants you to think of its service as the canonical location where your data lives. It’s available for OS X/MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS.
Its three-person founding team is nothing short of impressive. Bertrand Serlet was the former Senior VP of Software Engineering at Apple who oversaw every release of OS X through Snow Leopard and kicked-off the project that later became iOS. Alex Kushnir previously worked at MongoDB and was the founder of the banking-focused file management service Kazeon (which he then sold to EMC). Roger Bodamer previously worked at Oracle, Apple and a number of other Silicon Valley companies.
The company was founded in 2012 to address the growing concern of local data storage on mobile devices. Their solution was to write directly to the cloud, allowing users to mostly bypass the local stage. To do so, the company built the technology from the ground up, including servers, the infrastructure technologies and series that extract metadata from the files, allowing them to be searchable.
The result was a stable experience, but not that different from its competitors.
Clearly Western Digital found something it liked in Upthere and decided to bring it under its fold. Terms of the deal were not released.

Catherine Shu,Apps,"Leela Kids is a very straightforward app that nonetheless might prevent some parents from going insane. It curates podcasts by subject matter for age ranges from three to 15 years old and packages them in a kid-friendly interface. Leela Kids gives caretakers peace of mind that whatever their charges are listening to is age-appropriate and reasonably edifying. In fact, it recently hit the top spot in the Taiwanese App Store’s kids category after parents started downloading it as an English-learning tool.
Now also available for Android, Leela Kids was developed by Santa Clara, California-based Leela Labs, which launched last year to find better ways to find and listen to podcasts. Its main app, Leela, now hosts about four million episodes from across 30,000 podcasts, while Leela Kids currently hosts about 5,000 episodes from roughly 80 podcasts.
Leela Labs founder and CEO Sandeep Jain said he became interested in podcasts after someone suggested an episode of A16Z while he was researching online marketplaces.
“What struck me most was that despite living in the technology hub of the world, my information consumption resources had been limited to Google Search and certain print publications only,” Jain said in an email. “I had no idea that podcasts offered such amazing and relevant content and that I could consume this content while driving, at home, etc.”
Jain surveyed a group of tech-savvy friends and found that only two people out of 20 listened to podcasts.
“I quickly found out why—technology to access them is horribly broken,” he said.
Discovering podcasts is a cumbersome process that involves figuring out the right keywords to search, subscribing to shows and then scrolling through a menu to find individual episodes to download. While Apple is trying to make podcast discovery easier, the current method is annoying enough to put off casual listeners and nearly impossible for younger kids to navigate.
After realizing that even the grown-up version of Leela’s podcast player was hard for his four-year-old son to use, Jain decided to create a kids version. Leela Kids uses both tech and human curation to figure out which shows are best suited to specific ages, since that information usually isn’t included in a podcast’s RSS feed.
Parents might be incredulous that listening to audio content is enough to keep their kids engrossed when the wonders of Netflix, YouTube and Snapchat are just a click away on the same device. Jain says toddlers love listening to stories on the app, however, and that he has even managed to reduce his son’s screen time by playing podcasts during car trips and dinner. The startup plans to make Leela Kids compatible with smart speakers so older toddlers can operate the app themselves.
Parents of older kids, meanwhile, have told Jain that their offspring enjoy Leela Kids because it gives them a new way to discover content besides what they already read or watch.
“Parents and even kids are liking the ‘visual detox’ effect of Leela Kids,” he said.
The Leela team did not anticipate that Leela Kids app would be used as a language learning tool until a Taiwanese news site recommended it. After it took off in Taiwan, parents and teachers in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and China also began downloading Leela Kids to help kids practice English. As a result, Leela’s editorial team plans to add English teaching content in the future, including podcast episodes about grammar basics and more conversational content.
Other plans include adding episodes about parenting topics, working with parenting publications to integrate their calendars into Leela Kids so parents can get notifications about nearby events and making curated playlists with educators.
“Our vision is to make Leela Kids the defacto knowledge and entertainment resource for kids and even for parents,” said Jain.",2017-08-28,1532212,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/vsco-photo-1.jpg?w=738,startups/,"children,kids",Leela Kids opens up the world of podcasts to children,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/leela-kids/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Skidos, an edtech startup based in Copenhagen after relocating its HQ from New Delhi, offers an SDK to help games developers turn casual games into “learning apps”. The idea, co-founder and CEO Aditya Prakash says, is to flip the existing model where educational games often do a poor job of mimicking popular non-educational gaming titles. Thus, instead of gamifying existing learning content as it moves into the digital domain, Skidos wants to make it easier to put the learning content into casual gaming.
“After launching our first in-house educational game in 2014, I quickly realised that making fun, high quality games was very time consuming and expensive,” he explains. “However at the same time, we had strong evidence that 5-12 year old kids really found the game engaging and useful to practice math. We used this evidence to pivot towards developing our proprietary SDK which can convert popular mobile games into fun educational games”.
The Skidos SDK, which is initially focusing on maths, soft launched at the Nordic Game conference in May 2016 where, Prakash says, the startup got a “phenomenal response” from game developers. The first version of the SDK was then given a more formal launch that August and since then Skidos has partnered with 10 international game studios and has launched 9 converted games on the App Stores.
“If a pupil plays one of Skidos’ games for ten weeks or more, their accuracy level in math questions will, on average, go up by four percent besides increasing the time spent on practicing skills,” claims the Skidos founder.
But exactly how does the SDK let developers convert a casual game into a bona fide learning app?
In terms of the actual learning content, it has been designed as a replacement for worksheets and is mapped to popular maths curriculums. Specifically, once the game developer integrates the SDK, the learning content gets triggered at specific events when the child needs to advance in the game or win the virtual currency or special power up of the game — see the video embedded below.
From a technical perspective, it’s offered as a Unity package file which has its own Graphical User Interface (GUI) and libraries which communicate with the Skidos servers.
For example, Prakash argues that a game like Super Mario can teach children mathematical concepts of speed, distance, time, costs, height etc because they engage with these concepts in the game. “We have created many such concepts around mathematics along with other standard mathematics curriculum inside the SDK,” he says.
“There are companies who have tried to develop their own fun learning games but have failed to build a scalable business model,” adds Prakash. “At the same time, kids in the age group of 6-13 years are gamified since birth and spend an average of 2 hours daily playing casual games. We want to create learning opportunities for them during this time without compromising on gameplay or fun”.
To further that mission, Skidos has raised $750,000 in new funding. Leading the round are SEED Capital Denmark, with participation from unnamed Danish angel investors.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Wattpad, the social publishing platform behind apps for sharing original stories and chat fiction, is today venturing into video with the launch of a new app called Raccoon. Unlike its predecessors, Raccoon will focus on non-fiction video-based storytelling, with the goal of connecting people who want to create and watch stories that either entertain or inspire.
While Raccoon still fits within Wattpad’s broader mission of building modern-day storytelling products for web and mobile, the app feels like a more social experience. Instead of reading stories from authors whose real identities are often hidden behind handles, watching a Raccoon video is more like tuning into a YouTube vlog. The storyteller is right there on the screen, sharing something personal with you.
At launch, you can favorite stories by tapping a heart, or post them outside the app by clicking the share button, but Raccoon (perhaps smartly) doesn’t offer a commenting feature at this time.

If you want to participate in the community by posting your own video, you can click the plus sign at the bottom of the app to start recording. For those who aren’t sure what to talk about, there’s also an “I need inspiration” button that offers a story prompt.
Each week, there are new story challenges in the form of prompts. For example, this week, Raccoon is prompting users to share their travel stories. If the weekly challenge isn’t of interest, you can swipe left for more ideas, like “what’s unique about your family?,” “share a memorable childhood experience,” “share your biggest Tinder-fail,” “share a funny story that happened at work,” etc.

These stories are tagged, so you can find more of the same while browsing the app.
While recording, you can see when your video hits the 60-second mark – a subtle reminder that Raccoon wants videos that are only a minute or two long.
The app was developed out of Wattpad’s internal incubator, Wattpad Labs, which is also where its newer chat fiction app Tap got off the ground. Today, that app is the #7 app in the Books category on the App Store, just a couple of spots behind Wattpad itself. It has since grown to include over 300,000 stories. Meanwhile, Wattpad’s monthly audience is now 60 million.
However, both Wattpad apps on the App Store are trailing two other top chat fiction apps, Hooked and Yarn.
“Wattpad’s vision is to entertain and connect the world through stories, and as part of this we are constantly looking for innovative ways to evolve the storytelling process,” explains company co-founder Ivan Yuen about Wattpad’s move into video. “We know that video will play an important role in the future of storytelling and wanted to create a place where storytellers can authentically connect with audiences around shared experiences,” he adds.
The new app is designed to appeal to those aged 18 to 35. This age group, Yuen says, is already accustomed to the Snapchat’s and Musical.ly’s short, vertical video format, but are craving “more substance and meaningful connections with people,” he believes.

Josh Constine,Apps,"What if you could see if your Instagrams made people happy, surprised or disgusted? That’s just one of the innovative features of new photo-sharing social network Polygram. Using facial detection, Polygram gives you analytics about the emotional reactions people have to the photos you post.
Polygram also has augmented reality makeup that lets you look more attractive instead of just silly like with masks in other apps. Plus, it’s developed a smart method of preventing screenshots where you can cover your photos like a fogged-up window, and people may only wipe clean a portion of the screen at a time.
After raising $2.1 million in seed funding, today Polygram launches its iOS app with dreams of usurping Instagram and Snapchat.

It will be a tough uphill climb, especially if the social giants copy Polygram’s emotion detection and other cool features. But co-founder Faryar Ghazanfari thinks it can grow by attracting users who want to A/B test their social media with Polygram’s facial analytics to pick what to post elsewhere.
“Influencers and content creators are the oxygen in this ecosystem,” Ghazanfari tells me. “We have white glove service for influencers, with full-time employees that just create custom features for them.” If the app can deliver enough utility and views, he thinks people might start purposefully sharing on Polygram too.
I met Ghazanfari at TechCrunch’s annual summer August Capital party. He asked about a story I wrote about Facebook acquiring a company called FacioMetrics that had researched letting you Like photos by smiling, then claimed his fledgling startup Polygram had actually built that. The demo was impressive.
With just a minimal 20 milliseconds of lag, Polygram shows a wireframe mirror of your face that recognizes a wide variety of emotions corresponding to different emoji. It relies on an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to detect how your face moves and map it to a specific emotion. As I smiled, frowned and raised my eyebrows, Polygram accurately surfaced the related emoji.

This tech is the basis of Polygram’s Instagram-ish social network. When sent a private message, you can respond with a face-triggered emoji reaction. And when you post a photo, you’ll see the emotional response tallies of your audience, though without names attached so you can’t get mad at a friend for looking grossed-out by your selfie. You also can see exactly where around the world your viewers are, and get audience breakdowns by demographic if you only care how a certain gender feels about your post.
Some extra features include the ability to post permanent or ephemeral photos and videos, with the option to make a disappearing image everlasting after you post it. There are the typical Snapchat-style face filters, but there also are more subtle ones designed to beautify you like Meitu instead of making you puke rainbows or look like a puppy.
Perhaps the savviest feature, and the one I almost hope Snapchat or Instagram copies, is Polygram’s “wipe-to-reveal.” It lets you choose to protect your private messages from screenshots.
When delivered, your friend will see a blurry image as if was behind a condensation-covered window. By wiping a finger over the photo, they clear the fog and are shown what’s underneath. But the fog quickly reappears, so only a swath of the photo is visible at a time. With enough wiping, you’ll see and remember the whole image piece by piece, but if you try to screenshot or take a photo with a second camera, only the currently visible section will be recorded. Plus, you’ll be alerted if they screenshot it, and get sent a copy of what they captured.
Starting a new social network from scratch is incredibly difficult. People have already made their connections on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. They loathe the chore of rebuilding this graph, posing a stiff challenge for Polygram.
Ghazanfari hopes to overcome this by recruiting influencers who’ll bring their own audiences with them. He says it’s already signed up a bunch who’ve been helping it refine Polygram’s features, and it wants to give them personal attention that Snapchat has notoriously denied to social media stars. “And in terms of monetization, we put these guys ahead of ourselves,” Ghazanfari declares.
But Polygram will have to sign up plenty of users to watch these web celebs, since they’ll only invest time in a platform that grows their fan base. Even with all its snazzy features, that may prove very tough, especially without much funding for traditional marketing.
Still, if Polygram’s app fails to gain mass traction, I’d bet its slick interface ideas will live on, whether it’s copied or acquired by the social juggernauts.",2017-08-25,1531440,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/polygram-facial-detection.png?w=738,startups/,selfie-masks,Polygram detects facial reactions to shared photos,"instagram,snapchat",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/polygram/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Seattle seems like an unlikely venue for a duel between bike-sharing companies: it’s rainy, hilly, its residents can’t drive and another bike-share program recently went belly up publicly and ignominiously. But Ofo, one of several Chinese giants in the space, is the third company to launch in the city in a month. It’s the company’s first foray in the States.
Pronto, the service that crashed and burned here over the last two years, used dedicated docks in various ostensibly high-traffic areas. This inconvenient model is one of several reasons it ended up shuttering in May — after being bailed out by the city last year, no less.
The new services follow the much better model of letting users pick up and drop off bikes anywhere. It’s already hugely popular in China, where Ofo recently raised $700 million to expand operations. Its rival, Mobike, had just raised $600 million — the latest, in both cases, of several rounds in the hundreds of millions.
Bike sharing, and indeed cycling in general, has never been quite as commonplace in the U.S., especially in Seattle, which, despite having a healthy outdoors culture, is simply not suited for casual biking. That said, it’s still a dense, growing and tech-savvy city that won’t dismiss this type of service out of hand. Car-sharing platforms like ReachNow and Car2Go have been embraced wholeheartedly.
The city just issued two permits for bike-share programs last month, one for San Francisco’s Spin and one for San Mateo’s LimeBike, and both now have wheels on the streets. I’ve noticed the orange (Spin) and green (LimeBike) bikes everywhere, and people are indeed using them.
Ofo will be the third to join in, and aims to have a thousand bikes in the city by the end of the month. Like the others, you’ll rent one by scanning the QR code on its back. A buck gets you an hour, although all the companies are exploring other models for frequent users.
Curbed, which is keeping close tabs on the industry, got details on the actual bikes ahead of the official Thursday launch. They’ll have three gears, baskets up front and be more lightweight than those from rivals. That should help with Seattle’s many hills, and airless tires will prevent flats on our treacherous, pothole-filled streets. No helmets, though, which for casual riders are probably a good idea given how crowded our main thoroughfares are and how inattentive most drivers here are. Have I mentioned how unfriendly Seattle is to bikers?
All the bike-share companies are currently flouting Seattle’s helmet law, but it’s unlikely cops are going to give you a ticket unless you’re doing something really dumb. Yield to pedestrians, please!
Of course, like Spin and LimeBike, there will be significant “rebalancing,” i.e. trucks carrying bikes up from the bottoms of hills and snatching them from the boonies. One feature I’d like to see is the idea of putting bounties on bikes near you that need to be moved to better locations. Why send a truck when you can pay someone nearby a quarter to roll it along a few blocks?
We’ll see how the current platforms pan out over the remainder of summer, but the true test will be fall. And winter. And spring. It rains a lot here and ridership will drop like a rock.",2017-08-16,1527677,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/bike-on-wall.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"mobike,seattle,bike-sharing,ofo","Ofo comes to the US, joining the bike-share fray in Seattle",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/ofo-comes-to-the-us-joining-the-bike-share-fray-in-seattle/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"ARKit is one of the biggest changes in iOS 11. Under the hood, Apple is about to transform the iPhone into a very capable augmented reality device. Felix Lapalme‏ has been looking at assets in the Maps app package to find out if the company is going to leverage augmented reality for turn-by-turn directions.
On July 22nd, he dug around a beta version of iOS 11 and found this mysterious 3D arrow for the Maps app:
You might think that Apple is going to use this arrow for traditional turn-by-turn directions on top of a map like in traditional navigation apps. But some code tells you to tilt your phone in front of your face when you’re using walking directions.
In addition to that, it looks like the Maps app is going to use your phone cameras. That’s a lot of smoke for a feature that could ship with the iPhone 8. And when there’s smoke, Apple hides it:
You might remember Google’s Project Tango. Among other things, Google promised to use augmented reality to provide turn-by-turn directions inside museums, malls and more.
Apple already announced that it plans to add detailed maps of airports and malls in iOS 11. iOS 11 and the next iPhone are shipping in September. So I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple talked about some feature that lets you walk around an airport to find the nearest coffee shop using augmented reality. It would look like this app developed by Andrew Hart‏, a developer who has been playing around with new frameworks:",2017-08-16,1527624,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/augmented-reality-being-used-in-gatwicks-north-terminal.png?w=738,mobile/,"iphone-8,iphone,arkit",Apple could guide you around your city using augmented reality,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/apple-could-guide-you-around-your-city-using-augmented-reality/
Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Pinterest is adding a new feature today that allows users to pinch a photo to zoom in and out on various Pins, matching a feature that’s available on a lot of other services, like Instagram.
Pinterest is trying to be a central hub of high-quality photos and videos centered around ideas and products, but this still more or less exemplifies that the ability to manipulate photos within the app has started to become table stakes for sites like Pinterest. It also has to refine its visual search product as more and more companies offer similar products, like Google (ironically also called Lens, the same name as Pinterest’s camera search product). As the company becomes increasingly focused on mobile and discovery centered around photos, users will start expecting the kinds of behaviors that exist on other services (like Instagram) to exist on Pinterest.
One of Pinterest’s core directives is to push people closer and closer toward a moment of inspiration where they act on some kind of idea they discover on Pinterest. That can include buying a product, downloading an app or even changing things in their closet based on something they see on Pinterest. If Pinterest is able to do that, it can go to advertisers and explain that it has a different kind of user behavior that they won’t find on Facebook or Snap — and get them to start spending a lot of money on Pinterest.
Zooming in on a photo to get a better look at something seems like a good feature for digging through cluttered photos in order to identify a product. Pinterest is giving users a way to take photos in order to search for products, but those kinds of amateur photos might not have the right products in focus. That might be especially true for rooms in homes and could hold true even for professional photos.

That might also help Pinterest fend off apps picking off certain use cases that the company has traditionally owned. Houzz, for example, is trying to become a go-to place for interior design and products you would buy for your home. That’s catapulted Houzz into a startup with a $4 billion valuation.
Pinterest is also making a small tweak to make the option to search visually on a Pin easier to find. All these kinds of tweaks may seem somewhat small. But the sum of these incremental changes may help Pinterest continue to show advertisers that it’s a company that deserves a big chunk of their ad budgets typically reserved for Google and Facebook. Pinterest recently raised capital at a $12.3 billion valuation, and if it’s going to justify that valuation it has to turn into a critical spend for marketers.",2017-08-16,1527585,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pinterest-zoom-gif.gif?w=738,mobile/,"pinterest,image-recognition",Pinterest users can now pinch-to-zoom on photos in the app,instagram,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/pinterest-users-can-now-pinch-to-zoom-on-photos-in-the-app/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Roughly 1 in 30 Facebook users tells someone Happy Birthday each day, showing Facebook’s first major emergent behavior is still going strong. Now Facebook is equipping the 45 million people sending birthday wishes each day with some new features.
Now instead of just posting a soulless “HBD” or “Happy Birthday!” on someone’s wall with no personal message, photo, memory, or anything that makes it feel sincere, you can post one of Facebook’s auto-generated, personalized birthday videos. Similar to the ones it shows on your friendversary with different people, the birthday video will show photos of you and the birthday boy/girl with stylized transitions.
These videos could make it just as easy to send something that shows you and a friend’s unique journey through life together as it does to send a generic string of text. That could make sending birthday wishes feel more authentic and valuable, and less like a boring chore. Facebook launched birthday message recap videos last year to aggregate text wall posts from all your friends into something more visual, but now each friend can send a happy birthday video.

And now when it’s your birthday, you can easily dedicate it to a charity. Two weeks before your birthday, you’ll get a prompt to choose from one of 750,000 eligible non-profits vetted by Facebook. Friends will get a notification about your fundraiser, and be able to donate on your behalf as a birthday gift.
Facebook launched the donate button in 2013, and last year let people easily set up personal fundraisers. Facebook has received some flack for charging a 6.9% + $0.30 fee, but that covers processing, security, fraud, and vetting to ensure people are giving to real charities. Facebook has told me this is not a revenue generator, and in fact its fees are lower than what other donation platforms like GoFundMe charge.

Last year Facebook said 100 million birthday wishes per day total. Birthday fundraisers could let people leverage the social obligation some users feel about sending birthday wishes, and turn that sentiment into actual good. It’s nice to see Facebook realize it’s created the “HBD” behavioral norm that wasn’t necessarily delivering much positive outcome or emotional resonance, and turn it into something more beneficial and nostalgia-inducing.",2017-08-16,1527509,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-birthdays.png?w=738,mobile/,facebook-birthday,45 million people send birthday wishes on Facebook each day,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/facebook-birthday-video-fundraiser/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Taking inspiration from line drawings, Reddit and Messenger, Facebook is overhauling the design of the News Feed to make it more legible, clickable and commentable. Specifically, Facebook now makes it much clearer where threads start and end in comments. Meanwhile, Instagram today got a little redesign itself with comment reels now being threaded so you can have sub-conversations in public.

Facebook periodically updates its design, typically stripping out unnecessary “chrome,” or user interface framing, to create a sleeker, more readable look. There’s more and more white space on Facebook, which could be intended to reduce eye fatigue during long browsing sessions and let your friends’ content pop off the screen more vividly.
Facebook’s design team writes “we did not want to just ‘fiddle at the edges’, but rather make something that billions of people use every day less frustrating.”
Both the Facebook and Instagram changes will roll out to all iOS and Android users over the next few weeks.



Facebook is adopting the Messenger bubble style for comments. This will make threading more obvious, but also encourage the rapid-fire conversations people typically have in private messages. Facebook has been trying to make comments feel more alive recently with fast-moving conversations becoming their own chat windows.

Facebook has made its navigation and feedback buttons bigger and easier to recognize with a new unfilled line drawing style. The News Feed, Video, Marketplace, Like, Comment and Share buttons now all feature this look. Meanwhile, Facebook is swapping the classic globe notifications icon for a more standard alerts bell. These could all be less distracting to the eye so you focus on Facebook’s content, not its chrome.

Other redesigns for legibility include higher contrast text that’s easier to see and circular profile photos that take up less space and feel more human. Link previews are now a little bigger, too, which could get more people clicking and sending referral traffic to other sites. However, Facebook says today’s changes shouldn’t impact the reach or traffic of Pages. The URL domain is now more prominent, appearing above the link’s headline, which could reduce the likelihood that users click fake/hoax sites that mimic popular news publisher URLs.

Facebook wants to make sure you don’t get lost several layers deep beyond the feed. Now you’ll see a more obvious header with a bigger black back button when you dive into a post from the News Feed. Facebook also says you’ll be able to “See where a link will take you before clicking on it,” though it already had link previews, blurbs and URLs, so we’ve asked for clarification here.

As Facebook and Instagram restyle themselves to boost usage, a question arises about design ethics. Is building a better mousetrap beneficial to society? Facebook and Instagram certainly allow communities and friend groups to grow their bonds, but when does fruitful exchange and sentimental entertainment give way to mindless scrolling?
As former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris discusses in his TED talk, over-optimization for engagement on social networks has created apps that are addictive to the point of being destructive.

Over the years I’ve repeatedly asked Facebook’s top executives like CPO Chris Cox and VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri about whether the company is doing research into how to prevent or minimize internet addiction that can stem from Facebook’s ad-driven business model, and I’ve never gotten a direct answer that indicates they think it’s a priority.
They do care about their users’ experience, with Cox telling me “We’re getting to a size where it’s worth really taking a careful look at what are all the things that we can do to make social media the most positive force for good possible.” But you can always have too much of a good thing.
The execs tell me Facebook wants to make sure all your time spent on its apps is “meaningful”. Yet at some point when people are sitting in the dark alone refreshing the feed over and over, it could be worth surfacing Internet addiction and mental health tips, or encouraging them to connect directly with a friend via messaging.
Perhaps one day our apps will be redesigned not just to soak up more attention, but to warn us when we’re neglecting everything else.",2017-08-15,1527216,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-redesign.png?w=738,mobile/,facebook-messenger,Facebook and Instagram get redesigns for readability,instagram,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-instagram-comments/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Facebook is again getting into the daily deals space, this time in collaboration with eBay. The company has launched a new feature within its Marketplace section on its mobile app, where a selection of inventory from eBay’s Daily Deals program is now available. The deals can be shopped directly in Facebook’s app, but checkout takes place on eBay’s website through an in-app browser.
The new addition expands the focus for Marketplace, Facebook’s answer to Craigslist. This section today is prominently positioned in Facebook’s mobile app, occupying the central spot on the bottom bar on iOS (or top bar on Android), in between the Video and Notifications icons.

Launched publicly last fall, the idea has been to aggregate the “for sale” postings from the social network’s various “buy and sell” groups, allowing for an easier, more centralized way to search and shop for items from local sellers. You can also list your own items for sale, and chat with buyers or sellers via Marketplace’s integration with Messenger.
To date, however, it has been a peer-to-peer marketplace, not a source for deals from third-party websites, like eBay.
That has now changed, as some users will see a new “Daily Deals” section when clicking into Marketplace.

 
The deals will emphasize those products in the Consumer Electronics, Fashion, and Home & Garden categories.
At the top of the page, there’s a countdown that indicates how long the deals will be available. Each item also displays the percentage off. But to see the actual sale price, you have to click into the deal itself.
There will be around 100 new items posted to this section daily, we understand. Deals can be shared with others via SMS or Messenger, which will link to the deal via eBay’s ShopBot app.
Facebook characterizes this as a test.
“We’re conducting a test to determine if people are interested in shopping for discounted products when they visit Marketplace,” said Facebook Product Manager, Akash Anand, in a statement shared with TechCrunch.
The Daily Deals feature is currently available to a small percentage of people in the U.S. as of earlier this month, and is displaying on both the Android and iOS Facebook mobile apps.

While eBay is the current source for these deals, Facebook’s arrangement with eBay is not exclusive. That means if this proves to be a popular feature, Facebook could expand Daily Deals to include those from other third parties as well.
For the time being, transaction revenue is not being shared between eBay and Facebook. Instead, users who click on a deal will be linked over to the eBay website within the Facebook app, where they can view more product details, and complete their purchase.
Daily deals is an area Facebook explored years ago, during Groupon’s heyday. The idea back then was to connect users to deals for area restaurants, shops, group activities, and more, from local businesses. But these days, businesses that want to reach customers on Facebook set up their own Pages, and run ads. Plus, the can entice users with Facebook Offers, which can also be run as ads.
The new Daily Deals section, on the other hand, gives Facebook more of a “real” shopping feature – a way to browse products from eBay’s trusted sellers, then buy right in the Facebook app.

Though a different angle on daily deals than before, it’s not the first time Facebook has dabbled with enabling commerce on its site. Most notably, the current “Shops” feature (originally called the “Shopping” feed) pulls in product listings from Facebook Pages, then lets you checkout from the seller’s own website, while still in Facebook.
Facebook has not publicly announced the Daily Deals feature, as it remains a test. It’s not clear when or if the feature may become more broadly available, but we understand it’s not connected with the European Marketplace expansion news announced yesterday.
Ebay also confirmed the test of Daily Deals on Facebook.
“At eBay, we are always looking to broaden our reach and surface inventory through new channels,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently running a test with a small subset of people on Facebook in the U.S. who can browse eBay’s Daily Deals on Facebook Marketplace.”",2017-08-15,1527155,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/fb-dollar-sign-mobile-alt1.png?w=738,mobile/,"e-commerce,facebook-marketplace,ebay",Facebook adds eBay’s Daily Deals to its Marketplace on mobile,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-adds-ebays-daily-deals-to-its-marketplace-on-mobile/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Despite the tepid reception for Facebook Stories, the social network is doubling down on its full-screen Camera feature. Today Facebook added the ability to go Live, shoot two-second GIFs and share full-screen text posts on colored background from Facebook Camera, which lets you share to Facebook Stories, Direct messaging and the traditional News Feed.

The features give Facebook Camera near parity with Instagram’s Stories camera, and could make it more flexible and attractive to teens looking for ways to share visually. Combining the Camera’s augmented reality face filters with Live could make people more comfortable broadcasting since they won’t have to show their real face.
Facebook had already offered colored backgrounds for status updates through the traditional composer. It tested a GIF creator in Camera last month. And Facebook tested Live via Camera earlier this month, after allowing users to go Live from the News Feed composer since 2016. But now Facebook is officially rolling out these features to all iOS and Android users.
Facebook globally launched Camera and 24-hour ephemeral Stories in March, declaring war on Snapchat directly after fighting by proxy via Instagram since last year.
But while Snapchat clones Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status have both surpassed the original to hit 250 million daily users, Facebook hasn’t given updates on how many people use its Camera and Stories. Critics in the West, where Snapchat and Instagram are popular, have dubbed Facebook Camera “redundant.” Some ask why we need multiple Facebook-owned properties to share the same Stories. Others find the Story bubbles atop the feed obtrusive, especially when people seem to be pouring very little content into the distribution channel. Right now only four of my friends have a Story posted.
But between Facebook’s launch of the augmented reality Camera Effects Platform in April and today’s addition of new features, Facebook seems hell-bent on making its Camera popular. It could always cut and run, folding Facebook Camera and directing users to Instagram Stories. But if Mark Zuckerberg is convinced video and visual communication is the future, and is betting Facebook can lead by offering an AR development platform Snapchat lacks, the company may be willing to take its lumps and wait for the trends to push people to Camera.",2017-08-15,1527172,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/facebook-stories-ios.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"facebook-live,facebook-stories,facebook-camera","Facebook boosts snubbed Stories Camera with Live, GIF & text sharing",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-camera-gifs-live/
Anthony Ha,Advertising Tech,"Push notifications are one of the main ways we connect with our apps —  but according to OneSignal CEO George Deglin, most of the tools for managing those notifications are too expensive without offering the features that developers need.
Deglin’s company started out as a Y Combinator-backed mobile developer called Hiptic Games. It was as a game developer that he said he first became frustrated with existing push notification tools — so Hiptic built its own system, which eventually became the company’s main focus.
OneSignal is announcing today that it has raised $7 million in Series A.
The company also says it’s become “the most widely used push notification delivery platform on the internet today,” pointing to data from BuiltWith and AppFigures Explorer to show that its technology is used by more websites and apps than more established, better-funded competitors.
One of the reasons for OneSignal’s popularity is that it comes at the right price — it’s free for customers if they’re willing to share their interest and transaction data with large brands and advertisers, who can then use that data for better targeting. From a privacy perspective, Deglin said it’s similar to sharing user data with an ad network.
The “vast majority” of the more than 220,000 developers who use OneSignal are on the free version, Deglin added. He also argued that focusing on the free tier forced OneSignal to make the product easy to integrate and use: “The platform is open to so many people that we can’t count on having the resources to educate them on how to use every piece of the product.”
On the product side, OneSignal allows developers to run automated campaigns to re-engage users, with features like message localization, personalization and scheduling. Next up, Deglin said he wants to add support for other messaging channels — in fact, OneSignal has already integrated with Alexa notifications.
The new funding was led by SignalFire, with the firm’s co-founder and managing partner Ilya Kirnos joining OneSignal’s board of directors.
“We started SignalFire to find companies like OneSignal that have huge traction and passionate customers,” Kirnos said in the announcement. “As soon as we discovered OneSignal, we knew we had to invest — they have the team, vision, and traction that few companies their size ever do.”
OneSignal has now raised a total of $9.5 million. Other investors include Rakuten Ventures, Safegraph CEO Auren Hoffman, Factual CEO Gil Elbaz and Drawbridge CTO Devin Guan.",2017-08-15,1526759,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/push.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"push-notifications,signalfire,onesignal",OneSignal raises $7M for its free push notification tools,y-combinator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/onesignal-series-a/
Anthony Ha,Apps,"GoDaddy may be best known for its web domain registry (a business that’s been in the headlines recently), but it’s also moving into the voice and telephone business, starting with last year’s acquisition of FreedomVoice.
Today the company is launching a new app called SmartLine, aimed at addressing a basic need of small businesses — more and more of them (86 percent, according to a GoDaddy survey) are using their smartphones for both work and personal calls, but they don’t necessarily want to give everyone their personal phone number.
So SmartLine creates a second number that connects to a customer’s iOS or Android device. The obvious comparison is Google Voice, but Barry Saik, GoDaddy’s senior vice president and general manager of telephony, said SmartLine is different because “the other products in our category are not as singularly focused on that small business owner.”
So there are some distinctions that may look relatively subtle, but which Saik said are important to GoDaddy customers, like showing both the caller ID (assuming they’re in your contacts) and the fact that a call is coming from SmartLine (so that you know it’s business-related) on the same screen.

Other features include the ability to fully configure SmartLine from the mobile app (without visiting a website), to set business hours (so that calls outside of those hours go directly to voicemail) and to receive voicemail transcriptions.
Saik also pointed out that the SmartLine app brings all your interactions with someone  — both voice and text — together in one window.
And there are plans for more features, like vanity numbers, toll-free numbers and sharing a single phone number between multiple employees’ cell phones.
A SmartLine with unlimited calling and texting costs $9.99 per month. You can also pay $3.99 per month for up to 100 minutes and 100 text messages — Saik said this “basic” plan is designed for customers who are just getting their businesses off the ground and want a professional phone number, but they’re “not ready to use all the minutes.”",2017-08-15,1527016,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/godaddy-smartline.jpg?w=738,mobile/,godaddy,GoDaddy launches SmartLine to give businesses a second mobile phone number,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/godaddy-smartline/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Snapchat’s got a new trick to stay one step ahead of Instagram by turning everyone’s quick video clips from concerts into a much more watchable music video you control.
Snapchat “Crowd Surf” uses artificial intelligence machine learning technology to analyze when lots of people are all recording the same musical performance at the same time. It can then lace together the different angles while keeping the song playing smoothly so you can choose where to watch from and see more than 10 seconds of footage in a row. You can see a demo recorded by TechCrunch below:
https://youtu.be/xQkapLhuGV0
Snap tested out Crowd Surf last night at pop singer Lorde’s performance at San Francisco’s Outside Lands music festival. When she played her hit “Green Light” and everyone thrusted their phones in the air, Snapchat combined the clips. You can watch the Crowd Surf in the Snapchat “Featured” section below your friends’ recent Stories, and tap to see a new angle whenever the flipping phone Crowd Surf icon is lit up.
The result is remarkably fun to watch. You can hop from the center of the crowd to the front row to the side stage to get an immersive look at what it was like to see the concert in person. In fact, I did see the show in person, but Crowd Surf lets me watch how everyone else was enjoying the same moment.
Several now-defunct startups like Vyclone and CrowdSync have tried to build whole apps around the Crowd Surf idea, but most failed because they weren’t getting enough content submissions. Bolting the feature onto an already wildly popular app should prove more successful for Snapchat. The company pioneered the crowdsourced Our Story three years ago at the EDC music fest, and now it’s back pushing the bar higher.
Which begs the question…how long until Instagram Stories copies this? Both Snap and Instagram are in a heated war for users, with Snap inventing new features and Facebook’s giant Instagram team quickly cloning them to the detriment of Snap’s growth.
Each wants to encourage users to submit their posts for public display. Snap lets you syndicate your post to Our Stories before you share it, which then appear in curated Our Stories, search results, and the new Snap Map. Instagram Story Search pulls together posts tagged with locations and hashtags for dedicated Stories about different places and topics.
We’ve asked Snapchat for more details on how Crowd Surf works. The company says it’s based on in-house AI technology and will roll out slowly to more events. Mashable spotted it this morning. Snapchat previously offered Story Explorer that let you check out similar Snaps to one you enjoyed during a Live Story by analyzing location and time, but not audio.
Crowd Surf is set to be available at more public events in the future including concerts and speeches, but will require tons of people shooting and submitting Snaps from the same moment. That could limit it to huge events like music festivals, though perhaps it could work for parades, sports events, or political rallies too. And the mere existence of the feature could attract more submissions.
If people think their Snaps could get chosen for Crowd Surfs and get extra viewers, they might be more likely to shoot and share on Snapchat when they’re watching a concert.",2017-08-14,1526828,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/snapchat-music.png?w=738,mobile/,snapchat-clone,Snapchat “Crowd Surf” stitches together everyone’s concert videos,"snapchat,instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/snapchat-crowd-surf/
Sarah Perez,Media,"Facebook is rolling out a “Trending News” section on mobile that includes its own link in the app’s main navigation. This follows the company’s earlier announcement this spring of a redesign for Trending Topics, an increasingly important part of Facebook’s social network, where it tracks the news stories that are buzzing across its service. That redesign is now rolling out to users on iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., while the added navigational link to Trending News became available on iPhone over the past few weeks, and is in testing on Android, Facebook tells us.

In case you missed Facebook’s announcement in May, the Trending Topics section was redesigned with a focus on making it easier to see how other publications are covering a topic, in addition to what friends and public figures are saying about the matter.
When you click into a Trending Topic following the update, Facebook explained you will see a carousel of stories from other publications that you swipe through horizontally.

The publications linked to in this section are determined by engagement around both the article and publisher in general on Facebook, as well as what other articles are linking to it.
This card-style carousel look-and-feel was inspired in part by Facebook Paper, the company’s long since shuttered standalone news reading app.
This carousel is still in the process of rolling out across the U.S.
However, one aspect to Trending’s makeover that wasn’t really touched on during Facebook’s earlier announcement was how Facebook was toying with a redesigned list of news stories that focused on headlines, not just “trending topics.”
The original look for Facebook’s Trending Topics – which you pull up with a tap into the app’s search box – is a simple list of topics and the beginning of a lede that’s usually cut off. These appear below your own recent Facebook searches in the app.
However, if you access the new Trending News link that’s just popped up in Facebook’s navigation menu, you’ll see an entirely different sort of Trending section.

Above: Old Trending on left vs New Trending on right
Instead of a “topic” (often just a word, person or place, like “China” or “Donald Trump”) and squiggly arrow icon, the news stories here include a headline, a photo, the name of a major media outlet that’s reporting it, and how many other sources are available on the topic.
For example, next to the headline, it might say: “Reuters and 100+ other sources.”
Plus, by adding the photo next to each item, there’s more room for expanded information – that is, a full headline and sourcing.
The new section also gives stories a rank (#1, #2, #3,…etc.)
Facebook’s prior announcement in May didn’t specifically detail how this Trending News section looked different from Trending Topics.
Frankly, it’s all a bit confusing, because Trending Topics and Trending News don’t seem to be tied directly together at this point. For example, you could have the link to Trending News in your app’s main navigation, but still not have the new look for Trending Topics, which includes the carousel redesign.
However, in that same post, we did get a little peek at Trending News – but it was referenced as being a part of a “small test.”

Trending integration in News Feed still a “small test”
Facebook said then it was testing adding the top three Trending News stories to users’ News Feeds. In a screenshot of this, you were able see this list of stories with photos that were ranked by numbers, as well as stories identified by headlines instead of just “topics.”
This integration of a “mini” Trending News section into News Feed is not broadly available. That remains a “small test,” we understand.
But the addition of the Trending News link to Facebook’s navigation is already live on iPhone, and being trialed on Android.
Of course, any changes Facebook makes to Trending are sure to met with a lot of scrutiny. The company last year faced criticism when it removed its human editors who curated this section, to run Trending by way of algorithms instead. (And those algorithms soon screwed up.) The social network has more recently made several changes to address the spread of fake news and filter bubbles, as well.
In this case, though, Facebook is not monkeying with how news is selected as “Trending,” only how it’s being displayed.
The new Trending News section joins a number of other new additions to Facebook’s main navigation as of late, including the food ordering option, Town Hall, weather, the Explore feed, and more. Not all these additions have stuck around – the new travel-focused City Guides section, for instance, has since disappeared.",2017-08-14,1525266,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fb-mobile-news-feed-photos-ios.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"mobile,news,apps","Facebook is rolling out a Trending News section on mobile, now with its own link",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/facebook-is-rolling-out-a-trending-news-section-on-mobile-now-with-its-own-link/

Sarah Perez,Mobile,"Google today is expanding its speech recognition capabilities to support dozens of new languages, particularly those in emerging markets in India and Africa, the company announced this morning. That means more people around the world will gain the ability to search the web by voice as well as type via voice using Google’s keyboard app, Gboard.
The company says with the update, it’s adding 30 languages and locales around the world, bringing the total supported to 119. The update includes 8 more Indian languages, as well as Swahili and Amharic, two of Africa’s largest languages.
The new speech recognition will be initially supported in Gboard for Android and Voice Search. U.S. English speakers, meanwhile, can now use voice dictation to express themselves using emojis, too. (e.g. you can just say “winky face emoji” instead of hunting for it.)
The new languages are also available today in the Cloud Speech API, which already supported 89 languages, and is used in a number of third-party voice and video applications, like transcription services, speech analytics applications, IVR applications, and more.
In time, the new languages will be added to other Google products, including the Google Translate app.

However, the more critical part of this news is what this means for those in emerging markets – regions that are often ignored when it comes to being among the first to gain access to new technology advances from tech giants.
But with mobile, that’s changed. Tech companies are now aiming to establish footholds in these regions, as the next large swath of internet users come online.
In India, especially, Google’s move to expand speech recognition tech could have a significant impact. The country is estimated to have some 420 million mobile internet users as of this June, making India one of the biggest markets in the world for companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to address.
Google’s expansion with voice technology also comes shortly after a piece in The Wall Street Journal detailed how tech companies are rethinking their products for the developing world – in particular, how the next billion mobile users will heavily take advantage of technologies like video and voice. Google, for example, told The WSJ, that it’s been seeing “a new kind of internet user” – a group that’s “very different from the first billion” in terms of how they access the web.
To develop speech recognition capabilities for these new languages, Google combined human labor with its machine learning technology.
The company says that it works with native speakers to collect speech samples by asking them to read common phrases. This, in turn, helped to train Google’s machine learning models to better understand the sounds and words of the new languages to improve their accuracy when they were exposed to more examples over time.
The full list of new languages includes the following:",2017-08-14,1526593,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-14-at-9-48-20-am.png?w=738,mobile/,"machine-learning,speech-recognition,voice","Google’s voice typing tech adds support for 30 more languages, reaching further into Africa, India",google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/googles-voice-typing-tech-adds-support-for-30-more-languages-reaching-further-into-africa-india/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Snap’s Spectacles sunglasses may prove to be more of a fad than a must-have device. Snap revealed during its call following weak Q2 earnings that it generated $5.4 million in “Other” revenue, which would equate to around 41,500 pairs of its Spectacles camera sunglasses at a $130 price point. That’s compared to $8.3 million in Other revenue in Q1, or fewer than 64,000 pairs, meaning Spectacles sales have declined roughly 35 percent.
Snap recently began selling Spectacles on Amazon and in other companies’ retail stores, like Harrod’s, but those sales won’t show up til Q3 earnings. Snap did start selling Spectacles online and through its Snapbot vending machines in Europe for the first time back in June. That means the 41,500 number may have been propped up by this expansion, and sales in the U.S. may have slipped further.

Snap may either need a radically different, AR-equipped version 2 of Spectacles to reinvigorate interest, or it may need to look to other cameras to sell. It recently acquired Zero Robotics, a Chinese maker of the Hover selfie drone, for between $150 million and $200 million. Sources told TechCrunch today that the deal is complete. But more potential may lie in a camera people can fit in their pockets, like a 360 camera.

Josh Constine,Apps,"Snap has an awful Q2 earnings report… but at least its dancing AR hot dog was viewed 1.5 billion times. To prove their confidence, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have agreed not to sell any shares this year, and the company will withhold shares they’re owed to pay for any necessary taxes. Of course, there are only five months left in the year, so this isn’t exactly a long-term lock-in.
One concrete metric announced was that Snap generated $5.4 million in “Other” revenue, which would equate to around 41,500 pairs of its Spectacles camera sunglasses at a $130 price point. That’s compared to $8.3 million in Q1 and $4.5 million in Q4.

Josh Constine,Apps,"SoundCloud will soon collapse if investors don’t vote for a rescue funding round tomorrow. The stumbling music streaming community site had to suddenly lay off 40 percent of its staff last month. Now it’s asking investors for $169.5 million at a pre-money enterprise valuation of just $150 million, according to Axios‘ reliable business editor Dan Primack. That’s a steep drop from the $700 million valuation of its previous rounds.
If SoundCloud doesn’t get the funding, CEO Alexander Ljung reportedly told investors that SoundCloud won’t be able “to continue as a going concern.” That could force SoundCloud to sell even though Ljung has stubbornly fought to keep the dying startup independent. If it can’t find funding or a buyer, SoundCloud could vaporize, destroying its massive archive of user-uploaded music, podcasts and other sounds.
Investors would be forgiven their distrust since SoundCloud has burned over $230 million in funding plus $70 million in debt with little monetization progress to show for it.
[Update: At least this new funding deal would bring in new management. Recode reports that former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor would replace SoundCloud CEO Alex Ljung if investors do provide the funding.]

Last month we detailed the many, MANY problems with SoundCloud. Employees told us the company is “a shitshow,” with a lack of product direction, talent leaving and employees secretly using Spotify.
Rather than focus on its unique value proposition of being the “YouTube for Audio” with demos, DJ sets and remixes available nowhere else, SoundCloud chased dreams of grandeur as it tried to evolve into a Spotify competitor. But after taking years to negotiate deals with the major record labels, the extremely late $9.99 SoundCloud Go+ subscription service flopped. Meanwhile, it had burned credibility with core users like DJs by removing their music over dubious copyright claims while trying to suck up to the labels.
SoundCloud lavishly spent money on offices around the world while its CEO galavanted at music festivals like a rock star. SoundCloud recklessly wasted money, hiring people up until the moment it announced they’d be immediately let go as part of the 173 layoffs it announced last month. Now staff morale is in the toilet, the user experience is a mess, the subscription models are unappealing, competitors are growing rapidly and musicians are fleeing to other upload platforms.
That’s why it seems crazy for investors to fund a $170 million Series F to keep a sinking ship afloat a little longer unless SoundCloud is willing to swallow its pride and get acquired for whatever it can get.
The new investors would be Raine Group and Temasek, plus existing backers Union Square Ventures, Doughty Hanson and Atlantic Technology. They’d at least get preferred stock that’s paid out upon exit before previous investors. But how are they to know they won’t get diluted too when SoundCloud runs out of money again? The new deal would reportedly reduce the liquidity preference of the previous Series E investors by over 40 percent.
We reached out to SoundCloud PR and its CEO for comment or clarity on the do-or-die fundraise, but didn’t hear back.
Investors’ best bet is to fund a small bridge round just big enough for SoundCloud to shop itself around and find a buyer. Perhaps Google would buy it to align the YouTube of Audio with the YouTube of YouTube. Or Amazon could step in and try to do for musicians what it did for book authors by creating a convenient aggregated marketplace, though acquiring Pandora might better mesh with Amazon’s mainstream demographic.
SoundCloud has proven it can’t manage itself. It’s too damaged, too in debt and too far behind to thrive independently without a miracle turnaround. No matter what, the whole service is on shaky footing, so musicians may want to archive their audio and start promoting their presence somewhere safer.",2017-08-10,1525623,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/soundcloud-money.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"alex-ljung,soundcloud",SoundCloud faces do-or-die vote by investors,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/soundcloud-shut-down-possible/
Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Things are not going so well for Blue Apron this morning after reporting its second-quarter earnings (its first earnings report ever), and the stock is crashing as a result of it.
The company’s stock is down more than 14 percent on the earnings report, which came in pretty mixed compared to what Wall Street wanted. Blue Apron is looking to pull back on its marketing spend as it tries to get its burn under control, which resulted in a drop in its number of customers. The company was able to squeeze out a small profit in a past life, but since then it began to aggressively spend on marketing as it sought to acquire customers.
The problem quickly became getting those customers to stick around and keep buying meals. This time around, the company was able to improve the health of its customer base as they are spending more money and buying slightly more meals, but it still has to show that it can grow that base even as it starts to pull back on marketing. The company reported a loss of 47 cents per share on revenue of $238.1 million, while Wall Street was looking for a loss of 30 cents per share on $235.8 million.
Chart time:

So, better than expected revenue but with a widening loss even, as it pares back its marketing expense. The company gave off some negative signals about its next quarter, forecasting a loss between $121 million and $128 million in the second half, according to Business Insider. These comments were likely made on the earnings call, which we’re reviewing right now. But those kinds of negative signals are going to punish a freshly-IPO’d company, especially amid a period of wild uncertainty with the decline of Snap and possible fading appetite for new IPOs.
If Blue Apron sees some turbulence heading into the back half of the year, the persistent threat of Amazon definitely isn’t going to help. Information is slowly dripping out that Amazon is gunning for the meal-kit delivery space, which has crushed the stock over time. The company went public at $10 per share, but has since collapsed and lost nearly half its value.
Still, the IPOs will continue to come. Dropbox is reportedly inching closer to an IPO, and TechCrunch previously reported that Stitch Fix has confidentially filed for an IPO.",2017-08-10,1525560,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-803395778.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"earnings,blue-apron,ipos,finance",Blue Apron is having a really bad day,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/blue-apron-is-having-a-really-bad-day/
