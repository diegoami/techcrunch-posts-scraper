Josh Constine,Apps,"Facebook will become the suggester of perspective to avoid being the “arbiter of truth”. It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers.
If users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace.
Pre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons.
Meanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network  will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them.”
Facebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false.
“People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false.”

Facebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box.
So how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms.
If Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results.
While objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart.",2017-08-03,1522949,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/fb-fake-news.jpg?w=738,social/,fake-news,Facebook fights fake news with links to other angles,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/facebook-related-articles/
Anthony Ha,Apps,"Oren Peli, who wrote and directed the enormously successful film Paranormal Activity, is launching a new iOS and Android app designed to help users create, find and join local events.
Spot‘s launch might be doubly surprising — not only is Peli launching an app, but it seems like an odd idea to come from someone best known for horror movies (he also produced the Paranormal Activity sequels and the Insidious films).
However, Peli told me that before moving into movies, he actually started his career as a developer of animation software and video games. So in some ways, he’s simply returning to his old career.
The app also addresses a problem Peli said he was facing after finding himself single again and feeling that standard one-on-one coffee dates were starting to feel “a little monotonous.” What if, instead, there was an app that helped people connect around shared activities and interests?
There have plenty of startups sitting in the intersection of social, local and mobile, enough that the industry spawned its own obnoxious buzzword, but Peli is hoping Spot can rise above the rest by making it as simple as possible to join these events.

The Spot app allows people to create events in four categories: Hobbies, sports, community events and singles events. You can search for events by keyword, or just bring up a map showing what’s nearby. Events can be public or private, they’re shareable via social media and participants can chat with each other through the app.
“Spot’s technology means I can create events for just a few people or large events,” Peli said. “It’s an easy way to say, ‘Hey, I want to go hiking this afternoon, does anyone want to come with me?’ ”
When asked about safety, Peli noted that users create a Spot account by connecting to Facebook, Google or email, and they also can earn a verified user sticker by verifying their phone number over SMS. In addition, event organizers can ban users from their events and report inappropriate behavior.
Still, it seems like Spot is taking a fairly hands-off approach to the issue.
“I think that with a little bit of common sense, we can have a very nice and positive community,” Peli said. “We won’t allow anything unpleasant. If anyone’s harassing anyone, we’ll take care of that [by warning or banning users].”
Spot is available globally, but Peli said the initial focus is on building a community in Los Angeles. The app is free. Eventually, Peli said Spot could make money through advertising and by featuring deals from local businesses.
As for whether Peli’s time in Hollywood has affected the way he’s approaching his new startup, he said it was really the other way around: “When I got into film with Paranormal Activity, my experience as a video game programmer made me comfortable with all the technological aspects of it. I don’t know that the Hollywood experience had a similar effect.”",2017-08-02,1522934,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/oren.jpg?w=738,social/,"oren-peli,spot",‘Paranormal Activity’ director Oren Peli launches a new social app,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/oren-peli-launches-spot/
Devin Coldewey,Diversity,"Activist and writer Ijeoma Oluo is the latest to suffer for Facebook’s inability — or perhaps unwillingness — to improve its reporting and moderation infrastructure. After receiving hundreds of racist and threatening messages in response to a joke she made on Twitter, Oluo began posting screenshots when it was clear that days of reporting did nothing. Facebook’s response was to suspend her account.
You can read Oluo’s account of things here, including some screenshots of the type of abuse she was receiving. Twitter, she said, was responsive. Facebook, not so much.
Facebook later reinstated her account, calling the suspension a “mistake.” I’ve asked the company for the rationale behind the suspension.
We talked with another activist recently, Leslie Mac, who like Oluo spoke out on racism using the platform, and like Oluo was suspended from it. It happened to Shaun King, too, after he posted a racist email he received.
The pattern isn’t hard to figure out: when a person (often a person of color, often a woman, often both) is singled out by popular accounts and pages for something they’ve said or done, the mob descends. Abusive messages, comments and tweets arrive by the truckload — and while the target can only block and report so fast, groups of hundreds or thousands can flag a post or account so voluminously that it is taken offline.
Sure, that’s a “mistake.” The way the entire system Facebook has established for moderating the global conversation is a mistake. It is, at the very least, fundamentally flawed and inadequate.
Facebook and other platforms love to talk about the empowering nature of a one-to-many platform. They fail to address the problem that occurs when the platform is inverted and becomes many-to-one. There isn’t really a solution for the constant dogpiles that occur when someone incurs the wrath of an entire contingent of highly vocal abusers. Just let it happen and then sweep the “mistake” under the rug with the rest of them.
I happened to hear about Oluo’s situation by chance, but no doubt this is happening to many groups and many people whom I would never hear about. Are you one of them? Have you experienced this?
Maybe the mistake is people thinking these platforms are able to protect them at all. If so, the echo chamber will intensify as Facebook and other services may find themselves hosts to chilled speech under the de facto sway of countless angry mobs.
Facebook confirmed the content takedowns and suspension as mistakes on the part of its moderation team. They later sent a statement saying “We’re very sorry about this mistake. We allow discussions of racism but do not allow people to harass or attack others on Facebook.” It seems they got it backwards in this case!
I’ve also asked Oluo for more information and will update the post if I hear back.",2017-08-02,1522889,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fb-arbiter-of-truth.png?w=738,social/,racism,"Another black activist, Ijeoma Oluo, is suspended by Facebook for posting about racism",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/another-black-activist-ijeoma-oluo-is-suspended-by-facebook-for-posting-about-racism/
Sarah Perez,Social,"Facebook today announced it will soon be rolling out a change to its News Feed that will increase the distribution of links to faster loading web pages – including those that use its own Instant Article format, it seems. The change will negatively impact Pages whose links load more slowly, the company also notes.
The update to News Feed will roll out gradually in the months ahead, giving publishers time to make the necessary adjustments.
Oddly, Facebook’s blog post makes no mention of Instant Articles, despite the obvious connection here between Facebook’s own speedier mobile web format and its desire to increase distribution of links pointing to faster websites.
The Instant Article format was designed to make reading news stories via Facebook a better experience for mobile users. It does this by stripping out extraneous code that can bog mobile web pages down, while also placing restrictions on the number of ads they can display, among other things.
The format hasn’t been universally adopted by publishers, many who feel that Instant Articles decrease their ability to generate revenue from their sites.
Facebook has more recently begun to fix some of the problems publishers had been complaining about, however. It began to let Instant Article publishers show more ads, for example; it restored subscription options; it rolled out Page Like and email sign-up buttons; and it will begin tests of a paid subscription paywall feature in the fall.
It even tried to make adoption of Facebook’s format easier, by adding support for Google AMP and Apple News format as part of its Instant Articles software development kit.
Despite the fact that Facebook doesn’t directly state that Instant Articles are about to get a big boost from this News Feed change, it’s pretty clear that will be the case.
It won’t necessarily rank Instant Articles any higher than other fast-loading sites, but it certainly means those publishers using Facebook’s mobile web format won’t have to worry that they’ll soon lose clicks.
“We are not making this update to prioritize Instant Articles,”a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are making this update in response to what people have told us. We know that faster loading webpages are a better experience for people, both on Facebook and across the internet,” they said.

According to Facebook’s announcement, the company will take into account the estimated load time of a webpage when someone clicks a link in the News Feed on the Facebook mobile app.
It will also consider other factors, like the user’s current network connection speed along with the general speed of the web page in question. If the link loads more quickly, then Facebook will make sure the link gets a higher position in your News Feed.
When the updated News Feed algorithm is rolled out, Facebook warns that web pages that are “particularly slow” will likely see decreases in traffic. It did not, however, say how slow is too slow, pointing instead to a page detailing the best practices for improving mobile sites load time.
The company notes this is only one of many changes it has made to News Feed over the years to make things snappier for end users. For instance, in the past it changed the News Feed to display fewer videos when a user’s network connection speeds was slow. It also began to prefetch stories by downloading mobile content before links were clicked, when it identifying slower connection speeds.
Slower loading web pages, of course, are frustrating for end users. As Facebook points out, on the broader web, as many as 40 percent of website visitors abandon a site if there’s a three-second delay.
But it’s a bit disingenuous to announce such a change to promote fast-loading sites without even a mention of Instant Articles.",2017-08-02,1522560,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/instant-articles-e28094-poster-frame.jpg?w=738,social/,"news-feed,publishers,instant-articles",Facebook will soon start ranking faster loading webpages higher in News Feed,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/facebook-will-soon-start-ranking-faster-loading-webpages-higher-in-news-feed/
Josh Constine,Apps,"No one picks up the phone and everyone gets too much email. If you want to contact people for fundraising, a political campaign or marketing, texting is the way to go. But a generic mass text is more like spam than a convincing conversation.
Hustle lets you personalize every message and turn it into persuasive one-on-one dialogue. Like CRM for SMS, organizers can assign lists of contacts to their reps and field agents, who text them from their own numbers and cajole them to get down with the cause.
The potential to revolutionize both grassroots activism and corporate sales has won Hustle a new $8 million Series A led by existing investor Social Capital, whose founder Chamath Palihapitiya sits on Hustle’s board. That brings Hustle to over $11 million in funding to take the lessons it learned as Bernie Sanders’ texting tool for the 2016 presidential election and bring it to all kinds of organizations.

Co-founder Roddy Lindsay explains that “People don’t pick up the phone as much any more. Having a one-on-one conversation on text is the best way to get people to participate.”
Lindsay is well-versed on measuring what engages people. For six years he worked as one of Facebook’s first data scientists. His penchant for politics shone through, as Lindsay helped run Facebook’s congressional hackathon on Capitol Hill.
In 2014, Lindsay hooked up with former Obama ’08 Nevada new media director Perry Rosenstein to form Hustle. [Disclosure: Rosenstein and I were two of the co-founders of a social meetup utility called Signal that shut down before Hustle’s creation.] They set out to build a communication tool that combined the intimacy and ability to compel action of phone calling or door-knocking with the affordability and scalability of text messaging.

Here’s how Hustle works. Organizers build a phone number database, and write script templates on Hustle’s desktop app for the messages they want to send out. Their volunteers or representatives get assigned groups of contacts to ping through Hustle’s app, which automatically fills in variables in the scripts like the recipient’s name or how they got involved. The reps can rapidly send these messages via their own phone numbers, and reply like normal to answer questions or coax them into participation.
As respondents agree or decline to pledge money, show up to an event, volunteer or buy something, reps can mark their progress in Hustle’s analytics dashboard that tracks who they’ve contacted. And now Hustle is forging partnerships with payment processors and CRM systems to automatically track when recipients take action. Clients pay Hustle a monthly fee per contact in their database, starting at $0.30 per person.
While Hustle launched with a focus on politics, Lindsay says “We’re starting to do a lot of stuff beyond campaigns and advocacy. Higher education is a big growth area for us.” Now 30 schools are using Hustle for fundraising, like soliciting alumni donations without annoying phone calls. Amherst was able to double participation in its young alumni fundraiser from 10 percent to 21 percent using Hustle.
Those contracts have driven Hustle’s 40-person team to a $3 million annual recurring revenue runrate. And now Hustle has $8 million more to spend on accelerating growth. Joining Social Capital in the Series A are Canvas Ventures, Designer Fund, Foundation Capital, GSV Acceleration, Higher Ground Labs, Index Ventures, Kapor Capital, Matrix Partners, New Media Ventures, Omidyar Network, Twilio.org Impact Fund and Salesforce Ventures.
That last one could provide a well-aligned exit opportunity one day that could give Salesforce the same grip on text that its CRM has on email. “People respond to other people in a fundamentally different way than they respond to automated communication and bots,” Lindsay proclaims.
The cash will go first to building out Hustle’s platform and API so it can do more conversion tracking. That way, “If they say they’re going to give but haven’t yet, you can follow up,” says Lindsay. Hustle will also build out its sales and marketing teams for different verticals, growing its San Francisco, New York and DC offices. Its engineering team will grow, too, as it continues to support its iOS, Android, web and API surfaces.
Of course, for all of texting’s influence, it’s still only a piece of the communications puzzle. Hustle will need to develop ways to mesh better with the rest of an organization’s outreach strategy. And it will have to fend off clones trying to undercut its pricing. Hillary Clinton’s campaign developed its own version called MegaPhone rather than pay for Hustle.
Then there’s the issue that some people will still see Hustle’s texts as spam even if they’re sent by a real person from a real number. The startup may need to set frequency limits or usage restrictions to prevent clients from abusing Hustle.

Most startups stay away from polarizing politics that could limit their business, but Hustle refused to stay neutral. “We’re focused on building a strong business supporting clients in the Democratic Party and Progressive movement, and expanding into markets like Higher Ed and relationship-driven enterprises,” Lindsay says.
Supporting causes on both sides of the aisle could have gotten contentious, so Hustle chose the left. When ask if it refuses conservative clients, Lindsay admits that “If a potential client would violate our core values of Authenticity, Empowerment, Impact, and Respect, or erode the trust that our existing clients put in us, we would politely turn them away.”
Hustle is the kind of tech the world will need to claw back government from blustering leaders who exploit fear to divide people. Lindsay says Hustle wants “to make people feel like participants in the system and not just observers.” Motivated grassroots organizations can use Hustle to leverage the passion you see seething on Twitter into actual progress.
But that can’t wait until 2019. “Voter communication isn’t something you just need to do 30 days before the election,” Lindsay concludes. Whether it’s a campaign or a donation drive, people need to feel like there’s a person on the other end rooting them on like a personal trainer. Hustle conveniently puts that trainer in people’s text inbox.",2017-08-02,1522489,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hustle.png?w=738,social/,"telemarketing,hustle",Hustle scores $8M to kill telemarketing with personalized texts,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/hustle-texting/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Instagram Stories has blossomed from a Snapchat clone into an integral part of the world’s largest dedicated visual communication app in the first year since its launch. Half of the businesses on Instagram produced a story in the last month, and it’s boosted the app’s average usage to 32 minutes per day for those under 25, and 24 minutes per day for those 25 and up.
If Facebook’s goal was stop Snap in its tracks, it’s largely succeeded with Instagram Stories. Snapchat’s monthly active user growth rate has plummeted from 17.2% per quarter to just 5%, while Snap’s share price has fallen from its $17 IPO to $13. Instagram Stories now has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million. Instagram’s usage per day beats the “more than 30 minutes per day” of usage Snapchat claims on average now, as well as the over 30 minutes per day for under 25s and 20 minutes per day for over 25s Snap cited in its IPO filing.
[Update: News of Instagram surpassing Snapchat’s daily usage has caused Snap’s share price to sink to an all-time low aroun $12.67]

It’s clear to see why users are flocking to Instagram. It has stolen some of Snap’s primary use cases and party tricks. Instagram’s most popular augmented reality filter is the same as the Snap one it copied: virtual puppy ears. Also in the top five Instagram face filters are bunny ears at #3 and Koala ears at #5, both inspired by the meme-worthy popularity of Snap’s dog face. Meanwhile, Instagram keeps iterating with new features and sticker packs, like the one below to celebrate Instagram Stories’ first birthday.
Instagram is actually getting more efficient at copying Snapchat. While it took almost 3 years to launch its own version of Stories, Instagram needed just 4 months to copy Snapchat’s create-your-own-stickers feature launched in April.
Instagram not only copied Snapchat’s Stories, but has turned its Instagram Direct feature into a full-fledged Snapchat ephemeral private messaging competitor. By allowing people to send quick visual messages that disappear, Instagram Direct has grown to 375 million monthly users. Snap’s influence has helped Instagram’s chat feature one of the most popular messaging apps in the world behind WhatsApp, Messenger, and WeChat. Now one in five Instagram Stories posted by a business receives a Direct Message reply, allowing Instagram to seduce advertisers who want private channels for communicating with customers.

Instagram writes that “Stories made Instagram a place for people to share all of their moments – the highlights and everything in between”. If CEO Kevin Systrom set out to make Instagram an app for displaying everything fun in your life, not just the perfectly polished meals and vacations, it’s succeeded. And for better or worse, Instagram Stories has emboldened Facebook to put Stories into all its apps. WhatsApp Status has boomed to 250 million daily users, while Facebook Stories and Messenger Day are seeing weaker traction since they’re respectively redundant or obtrusive.
The flood of apps where you can post them is creating ‘Stories fatigue’ in some users like me. If the audience is fractured across five different apps and I have to go through a ton of work to post to them all, I sometimes reconsider whether it’s worth disrupting life in the present in order to show off to my friends. So while Instagram and Facebook are further popularizing the Stories format Snap invented, they may also be commoditizing it. Either way, the Snap threat is being neutralized.
Unless Snap can pull off a big uptick in growth when it reports earnings later this quarter, it may see Wall Street sour on its future the same way it did with Twitter. But you can bet Instagram won’t let up the heat.
A year ago, it looked like Snapchat was destined to rule social media. Its full-screen sharing would be impossible to outdo. There was no way to give a more immersive window into friends’ lives. But Facebook and Instagram didn’t have to outdo Snapchat. They just needed to copy it and put it in a more convenient place in apps that people of all ages already use.",2017-08-02,1522463,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/instagram-stories-steal-snapchat.png?w=738,social/,"instagram-stories,snapchat-clone",Instagram Stories turns 1 as daily use surpasses Snapchat,"snapchat,instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/instagram-stories-anniversary/
Katie Roof,Earnings,"Snap shares fell 4 percent and closed at a record low on Tuesday at $13.10, but it wasn’t just because of the dreaded lockup expiration, which allowed some insiders to finally sell shares.
Snap faced another devastating blow when it was revealed that the company won’t make it into the S&P 500, a popular stock market index. The way Snap has divided up its classes of stock have made it ineligible under the new rules, which state “the S&P Composite 1500 and its component indices will no longer add companies with multiple share class structures.” It’s also ineligible for the FTSE Russell, a major British index, because Snap’s public investors don’t have voting rights.
This is bad news for Snap because a lot of people are investing in overall indices instead of individual stocks. “It can be a reasonably big source of demand for some of these companies,” said Sam Angus, a partner at Fenwick & West.
The last thing Snap needs right now is more bad news. After pricing its IPO at $17 per share in early March and seeing an initial bump in the stock market, it has mostly been in steep decline ever since. Tuesday’s closing price was less than half of the $27.09 we saw on March 3.
Snap had a disappointing first quarter earnings results, so there’s extra pressure for it to outperform when it reports next week. Plus, many employees will not be eligible to sell shares until later this month at the next lockup expiration. If enough of them exercise their options, it will send the stock further in decline.
But some analysts think that the lockup fears have been overblown and that a lot of employees won’t sell shares yet. Plus, for many employees who joined in 2015 or later, their shares are underwater, so it wouldn’t make sense for them to sell yet.
The big question for Snap is whether it will be able to maintain user growth. Instagram copied its “stories” feature last year, which seemed to be a big blow to its service.
Yet Snap has proven to be innovative and could continue that trend. From disappearing messages to stories to AR-enhanced “lenses,” the company continues to have new ideas. Perhaps Snap is working on something that will be the next big thing.",2017-08-01,1522241,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/snapchat-push2.png?w=738,social/,snap,Snap hits record low after getting rejected from the S&P 500,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/snap-hits-record-low-after-getting-rejected-from-the-sp-500/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Facebook is reportedly working on dedicated video chat hardware, per a new report by Bloomberg. The device is said to be the inaugural major product from Facebook’s hardware-focused Building 8 product development lab, and will include a notebook-sized display. It’s intended to make video chat participants separated geographically feel like they’re together in the same space, the report claims.
Bloomberg’s report also claims Building 8 is developing a separate smart speaker product, similar to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, which would use a voice assistant developed by the social network provider. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg developed his own home voice assistant as part of a project resulting from his annual resolutions, which in 2016 focused on building a smart home companion similar to Jarvis from Iron Man.
This isn’t the first we’ve heard of a smart speaker in development at Facebook – a report last week sourced from DigiTimes suggested that the company’s supply chain sources indicated a smart speaker with an integrated 15-inch display was on track for a potential first quarter 2018 launch.
Based on the details of this new report, it sounds like the smart speaker and device with a 15-inch display may actually be two separate products. The 15-inch screen would fit with this fresh suggestion of a device with a laptop-sized screen tailored for video chat, at least.
Bloomberg also says the video chat gadget will include a wide-angle camera, built-in microphones and speakers, with artificial intelligence tech used to improve its photographic (offering zoom and lock features on people’s faces) and audio performance. In testing, it’s being supported by a thin stand that supports the display, which could reportedly be between 13 and 15-inches in size. FB is said to be considering Android for the OS, rather than its own in-house operating system.
Facebook has also tested a 360-degree camera for the device, which would fit with their push to bring 360 video to their social platform, but that won’t be ready in time for its initial planned product launch. It’s reportedly set to retail for “a few hundred dollars,” Bloomberg reports, with the standalone smart speaker aiming to sell for somewhere around $100; that speaker could be sidelined entirely, too, if Facebook decides to focus entirely on the video chat hardware.
A video chat device could make sense for Facebook in a number of ways, including as a way to lower the friction of video chat to make it accessible to a broad user base, rather than making it an additional service that requires logins and apps on platforms designed for general purpose use. Plus, it could integrate with Facebook Messenger, making that chat platform even more of a default option for broad communication, and helping it grow as a customer service transaction platform at the same time.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"VSCO is a brand well-known among photographers who take advantage of its presets for desktop and its mobile app featuring film-inspired filters and pro image tools. Now the company is moving into video editing, with the launch of its first video editing tool on iOS. The tool will allow users to apply presets and tools to any size video from their smartphone camera, then share the resulting creation across social media.
The new tool takes advantage of SENS, the company’s proprietary real-time image processor, and supports all iOS video formats up to 30 FPS at 4k and 60 FPS at 1080 or below with no size or length restrictions, the company tells us.
Its SENS technology platform is being positioned as a differentiator here, in terms of VSCO’s capabilities, as it moves into video editing. Prior to now, the platform is what allowed the company to roll out support for the high-quality RAW file format in iOS, and the addition of short video clips within the app, according to VSCO co-founder and CEO Joel Flory, talking about SENS in an interview with Fast Company this June.
However, the video editing tool won’t be available to everyone who has the VSCO app installed – it’s a feature rolling out to paid “VSCO X” members only.
VSCO X is the company’s annual membership service, which charges users $19.99 per year for those who want access to new features on a monthly basis, including presets, tools, educational offerings and more.
The video editing tool will initially become available to VSCO X members on iOS, ahead of its launch on Android, says VSCO.
To use the feature, members launch the app then tap the banner in their Studio where the video editing tool is being announced.
Videos from your phone’s Camera Roll will then appear here in the Studio, and you can choose the one you want to edit. You can use presets from the VSCO X library to edit the video along with other standard editing tools, like Contrast or Saturation. When your edits are complete, you can save video back your Camera Roll, where you can choose to share it out to other social platforms.
“VSCO’s mission is to help people become better creators, and video is a creative frontier we’re increasingly passionate about and focused on,” explains Flory, of the new tool’s launch. “Video editing for VSCO X members is a first step into what we see as limitless possibilities for video editing tools on VSCO.”
VSCO today has an active community in its app, which consists primarily of younger people, the company notes. Eighty-eight percent of its monthly users are millennials or generation Z, and 70 percent of the community is creating daily. The company reported at the beginning of last year it had passed a key milestone by surpassing 30 million monthly active users in its app.
At the time, VSCO hinted it would expand its product and platform into new areas in the future. It also had then just brought on COO Bryan Mason, who had previously worked at Adobe managing business operations for the launch of Creative Cloud, M&A, and led biz dev.
As for the VSCO app itself, it’s currently a highly ranked #15 in the competitive “Photo & Video” category on the App Store, behind other big names like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Google Photo, Musical.ly, Facebook Moments, and Adobe Photoshop.

Katie Roof,Fundings & Exits,"Snap, the Snapchat parent, closed the day down just 1 percent Monday after the first phase of the dreaded lockup expiration, which meant that some insiders are now eligible to sell shares. The anticipation of a big sell-off had been putting downward pressure on the stock for weeks, but it appears that enough of that fear was already built into the stock price to withstand Day One.
But while venture investors and co-founders were able to sell shares today, many employees are still locked up until later in August. There’s also a quarterly earnings report before then.
This means that the next few weeks will still pose significant uncertainty for Snap investors. A positive earnings report on August 10 could send shares rising, but a lot of employees may exercise their right to sell shares once they are allowed to on August 14, which could send it back down. But if the next lockup period sees little movement, investors may breathe a sigh of relief and the stock could regain momentum.
It is not uncommon for stocks to face volatility in the first few months as a public company. But some say Snap’s timing was off, because competitor Instagram found significant success after copying its “stories” feature.
Bulls of Snap point out that Facebook also struggled in its early days as a public company, but over the past five years the stock has at least quadrupled. Twitter, on the other hand, saw its stock surge in its first few months post-IPO. Investors lost enthusiasm amid slowed user growth and the share price has since seen steep declines.
Snap priced its IPO at $17 per share in early March. The stock closed Monday at $13.67.",2017-07-31,1521700,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/snap-floating.png?w=738,social/,"finance,snap",Snap down just 1% after first wave of lockup expirations,snapchat,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/snap-down-just-1-after-first-wave-of-lockup-expirations/
Mike Butcher,Apps,"There’s a lot of talk about the quantified self, but one of the grey areas remains working out your levels of stress. Usually this requires hardware devices. Now a New York-based startup thinks it’s come up with an approach based on specially developed algorithms and machine learning using simple heartbeat readings taken with a smartphone app.
Welltory (iOS, Android) has also now closed its second investment round, raising $1 million from business angels. This is being used to launch the next version of the app, which is aimed at cutting down your stress levels and boosting your productivity. Luckily the app is, in my opinion, a joy to use in terms of interface and over-all usability.
Here’s their idea: Google Analytics for humans, complete with AB-testing features and KPI goals. The idea is to work out the effect of how, for instance, morning meditation, working from home or a diet change might affect stress and energy levels. You then keep what works for you and discard what doesn’t.
While the main measurement comes through measuring your heartbeat, using the same PPG technology found in most pulse oximeters, it then applies variability algorithms to assess the state of the “autonomic nervous system” — the body’s stress and recovery regulation center. That’s how they come up with stress and energy levels.
In fact, this is the same technique used by professionals in sports. The Red Wings hockey team relies on HRV analysis to track training and recovery with Firstbeat. Similarly, NBA players like DeAndre Jordan and Matthew Dellavedova wear HRV-based WHOOPs during games.

But Welltory is aiming to bring this kind of monitoring to the masses.
Competitors in this space are usually hardware-based, such as the aforementioned WHOOP (which is a $500 device) and Firstbeat, which has several hardware partners.
Welltory is free as a basic version, but the paid version of the Welltory app has a Quantified Self Dashboard, which lets users collect data about their lifestyles.
It also can be synced with fitness trackers and Fitbits, Apple Health and Google Fit to collect data about sleep, nutrition and physical activity. It also supports RescueTime (a desktop-based productivity tracker), home weather stations that track your surroundings and more.
Over time it generates charts for you to work out correlations between behaviors. So for instance, you can see if walking an extra mile a day helps stress levels, or see if meditation sessions are affected by the weather that day.
Jane Smorodnikova, co-founder, says the “Quantified Self” remains a mystery to most, so bringing all the data together in one interface helps explain it. “They can see how their activity influences their stress, how many hours of sleep they need to recover properly and what lifestyle habits influence their productivity at work. Stress and energy measurements is the key that connects the dots of your lifestyle data and makes it easy to get real insights.”
Welltory says it currently has 125,000 users and 650,000+ heart rate variability measurements. It’s also got a healthy growth in paid users.
Co-founders Alexander Lyskovsky, Jane Smorodnikova and Pavel Pravdin are all quantified self aficionados who come from engineering backgrounds who wanted an approach based on science and hard data. They were advised by Professor Roman Baevsky, a space medicine expert who is currently a consultant at NASA and the Mars 500 project, who applied heart rate variability to the space program in the 1960s.",2017-08-08,1524928,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/app-dashboard.jpg?w=738,europe/,stress,Welltory packs a lot of science into its app to measure your stress levels,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/welltory-packs-a-lot-of-science-into-its-app-to-measure-your-stress-levels/
Natasha Lomas,Europe,"A major update to the UK’s data protection rules will place new requirements and responsibilities on companies that process users’ personal data, including by making it easier for consumers to withdraw consent their data to be processed; view what data is held on them for free; ask for their data to be deleted; and move their data between service providers.
The government published a statement of intent yesterday for the forthcoming data protection bill, setting out its aims and thinking, and confirming it will repeal the existing Data Protection Act to avoid creating any legal conflicts or confusion.
Under the incoming rules, teenagers will be able to ask social media companies to delete information posted in their childhood, for example — expanding an existing European legal ruling around a so-called ‘right to be forgotten‘ which currently applies to how search engines can index the personal data of EU citizens.
While widely used, much derided pre-ticked ‘consent’ boxes for processing personal data are set to be outlawed — with consent having to “unambiguous” (or “explicit” for sensitive personal data), as well as easy to withdraw .
The updated UK data protection legislation will also expand the definition of personal data to include IP addresses, Internet cookies and DNA; and make it a criminal offense to re-identify individuals from anonymized data — either with intent or through recklessness. The maximum penalty for this new offense will be an unlimited fine.
Digital minister Matt Hancock described the plans, published yesterday in draft form and following an earlier consultation, as a “balance between supporting innovation and data protection”.
“Our measures are designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account,” he said in a statement. “The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world.
“The Bill will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit. We have some of the best data science in the world and this new law will help it to thrive.”
Another new offense set to be created under the law is the altering of records with intent to prevent disclosure following a subject access request — this will also carry an unlimited fine in England and Wales.
The UK’s data protection agency is also set to get sharper teeth as a consequence of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which ramps up the size of the fines that can be levied by regulators for data protection breaches.
Currently in the UK the maximum fine the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) can issue is £0.5M. (Last year the agency issued a then-record fine of £0.4M to ISP TalkTalk for a 2015 data breach.)
Larger fines of up to £17M (€20M) or 4 per cent of global turnover will be allowed under the new rules — which the government says will enable the ICO to “respond in a proportionate manner to the most serious data breaches”.
The GDPR also shrinks the time-window when organizations are required to report serious data breaches to the ICO — down to within 72 hours.
“Businesses must notify the ICO within 72 hours of a data breach taking place, if the breach risks the rights and freedoms of an individual. In cases where there is a high risk, businesses must notify the individuals affected,” the government notes on this.
Companies also face obligations under the GDPR to conduct risk assessments if they carry out “high risk data processing” — in order to “understand the risks involved and mitigation required to prevent inappropriate usage”.
In a statement on the UK proposals, information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: “We are pleased the government recognizes the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public.”
Denham publicly condemned WhatsApp parent Facebook last year, after the company landed in regulatory hot water in Europe following a major change to the privacy policy of WhatsApp’s messaging platform that saw users’ data shared and linked with Facebook’s other data holdings, including for ad targeting purposes.
At the time of the privacy policy change, WhatsApp users were presented with a pre-ticked box consenting to the sharing of the data with Facebook — a move that drew widespread condemnation from data protection and privacy advocates.
“The reliance on default opt-out or pre-selected ‘tick boxes’, which are largely ignored, to give consent for organisations to collect personal data will also become a thing of the past,” the government asserts now, in its proposals to update domestic DP law.
The GDPR is due to come into force across the EU in May 2018, and much of the UK plans for updating domestic data protection rules are aimed at achieving alignment with the pan-European regulation. Even though the UK voted last year to leave the bloc, it remains an EU member during the two-year exit negotiation process and therefore must comply with EU law.
Beyond that, and when it comes to data protection rules specifically, the UK’s stated desire for a continued trade and information sharing relationship with the EU in the future — i.e. after it is no longer a member — essentially requires continued compliance with the bloc’s data protection standards.
Hancock himself said as much earlier this year, when he told a committee that the government wanted to ensure “unhindered data flows after Brexit”, which he said essentially meant “matching” the EU’s data protection rules, rather than the UK trying to strike out and set its own standards.
In the statement of intent for the new data protection bill, Hancock details how the government intends to handle some areas of permitted derogation from the GDPR — for example it plans to set the age at when a child can legally give consent for their data to be processed at 13 (the GDPR allows Member States to set an age between 13 and 16, though sets its own default at 16).
The UK also intends to continue to allow organisations other than those vested with official authority to process personal data on criminal convictions and offenses in “certain specified circumstances” — an existing regime which it says has enabled, for example, employers to perform “accurate criminal records checks”, and the underwriting of driving insurance.
And says it “will take a similar approach to that taken for the processing of special (i.e. sensitive) categories of personal data”.
Another exemption the government intends to exercise is to allow scientific or historical research organisations which gather statistics or organisations performing archiving functions in the public interest to be exempted from obligations to provide rights of access of individuals to the data held on them and obligations to rectify inaccurate personal data upon notification — although it notes this will only be the case “if compliance would seriously impair these organisations’ ability to carry out research, archiving or statistics-gathering activities”.
It also intends to exercise an exemption on automated individual decision-making. While the GDPR states that an individual has the right not to be the subject of a purely automated decision making process, it does allow for exemptions — “where suitable measures are put in place to safeguard the individual’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests”.
“Individuals will have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to them which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects them, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention,” the government notes.
The statement also confirms the government intends to legislate to provide for an expanded and modernized data protection framework specifically for national security purposes — an area that lies outside the scope of the GDPR.
This will be based on a revised Council of Europe convention, with the government saying it plans to introduce data protection standards “that reflect the huge growth in data and changes in technology”, and ensure “data is processed, not only lawfully, but ethically”.",2017-08-08,1524533,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/matt-hancock-uk-digital-director2.jpg?w=738,europe/,"law,general-data-protection-regulation,information,terms-of-service",UK to criminalize re-identifying anonymized personal data,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/uk-to-criminalize-re-identifying-anonymized-personal-data/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Following rumours that began circulating within London’s fintech community as far back as June, digital-only or so-called ‘challenger’ bank Tandem has announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Harrods Bank, the banking arm of the U.K.’s most famous luxury department store. Terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval.
Under the agreement, Tandem says it will acquire 100 per cent of Harrods Bank and benefit from around £80 million of capital coming into the business. On completion — and presuming U.K. regulators don’t wave a red flag — Harrods bank will operate under the Tandem brand.
In addition, Tandem says the acquisition will accelerate the launch of savings accounts to customers, pegged for before the end of the year. Tandem’s app — which doesn’t yet offer a bank account but instead is a Personal Finance Manager (PFM) of sorts. designed to help you manage your money — is available in the iOS App and Google Play Stores, whilst Tandem credit cards are set for launch in “the next few months”.
According to City AM, the acquisition will give Tandem a much-needed push against a number of other rival U.K. challenger banks, such as Atom, Starling and Monzo, “with a near-£200m loan book and over £300m of deposits,” even if Harrods Bank, owned by Qatar Holdings, is itself loss-making.
The proposed deal also comes after a somewhat shaky time for Tandem. Last December it announced that it had secured a £35 million investment from department store House of Fraser, owned by China’s Sanpower. However, restrictions on capital leaving China led to part of the investment being withdrawn and Tandem eventually losing its own banking license and having to re-jig the business, including layoffs. Acquiring an existing licensed bank may be a quicker way to get its own regulatory status back on track.
Update: Given that Tandem recently lost a significant part of its funding, I asked the startup bank to clarify what it meant by benefiting from “around £80 million of capital coming into the business” — specifically if that was referring to new investment and/or Harrods Bank’s balance sheet. Here is what a spokesperson for Tandem told me:",2017-08-07,1524098,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tandem.jpg?w=738,europe/,harrods,Digital bank Tandem to acquire banking arm of UK’s famous luxury department store Harrods,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/tandem-harrods-bank/
Mike Butcher,Europe,"Since founding the Techfugees non-profit two years ago, I’ve come acutely aware off the huge problems refugees face. With over 65 million refugees globally (according to the UN), and their ranks being swelled considerably by the civil war in Syria, it became clear to me that any solutions might help refugees would have to be scalable. Scaling solutions to problems is what the tech industry does, which is why Techfugees acts as a bridge between the tech community and the needs of refugees and refugees NGOs.
And that bridge is gradually getting closer.
Not only are individuals in the tech community getting involved, creating many open-sources projects, but private-sector tech startups are bringing their amazing solutions to these problems. I mean, if you can get your laundry done and delivered to your door, or order food or a limo with a smartphone, how transformational would it be to teach a refugee child the language of their host country, or help them integrate into a new country faster? Refugees have also been creating their own tech projects themselves, from the Syrian refugee answer to Etsy, Sharqi, to the app to help refugees navigate German bureaucracy. In Australia, a Techfugees hackathon helped give life to RefugeeTalent, a platform built by and for recently arrived refugees, and Refuhelp in France (below).

That’s why a new initiative from Unbabel, the Lisbon-based and Y Combinator-backed startup that combines machine learning with crowdsourced human translations, is so great.
Vasco Pedro, CEO and co-founder, has now launched Unbabel.org, a non-profit portal providing the company’s high-quality translation services to NGOs and charities free of charge. This will aim to remove language barriers and provide seamless communication for refugees worldwide.
Unbabel.org says it is already working with a number of organizations, including SPEAK which assists migrants in acclimating to their new community.
The startup has also partnering with Universidad Europa (Madrid) professors leading the Bachelor’s Degree program in Translation and Interpreting, who work with organizations such as UNICEF. By combining the power of students enrolled in the program with the technology provided by Unbabel.org, this initiative can be scaled to provide increased translations.
Here’s a short video about the initiative:

The company is now actively seeking additional charities and NGOs to partner with in order to provide necessary translation services to refugees, from helping them translate official documents to receive proper status, to aiding them in translating CVs to the local language to help with their job search.
Luckily Unbabel is not the only tech startup offering their services to refugees and refugee NGOs.
Babbel, another language startup out of Berlin, has donated courses budgeted at over €1M for refugee projects. And it’s also giving Babbel out for free to various initiatives, such as organizing in-house training for voluntary language teachers in refugee homes. In fact, it’s linguists have written up some great tips for people who want to help refugees learn languages in a series.
In the US, bigger companies like Airbnb have stepped up to the plate to allow hosts to join an Airbnb community who are providing free accommodation to those in need, enabling them to resettle their lives.
Meanwhile, ride-tracking startup Rydar is now offering any refugee contacting them through the app to use their service free for one year, giving them the opportunity to save money on ride-sharing services.
Techfugees has been gradually compiling a database of tech resources in this area, which is hope to turn into a sort of ‘CrunchBase for Refugee technology‘. But to give you a flavour, here are just a few of the other generous tech startups trying to aid refugees.
Sharood is offering to connect the refugees community to a place by sharing meals.
Funzi is a mobile learning startup geared specifically to emerging markets where refugees are typically located.
SolidarityApp allows you to donate to refugee causes when you download mobile games.
Point93, which helps people open online stores on Shopify, are donating their services free to refugees.
The telemedicine company Doxy.me are providing their platform for refugees to use for free through a project called HealthPath.
Redi-School is free of charge and teaching refugees in Berlin to code
London-based startup Bussu offers Premium Membership open to refugees who apply here.
Esri provides NGOs access to their mapping software.
There are of course many other tech companies doing good work in this area.
In a future separate post, I will be covering many of the specific tech initiatives to help refugees that have sprung up over the last couple of years.

Natasha Lomas,Apps,"Face-morphing app FaceApp, which uses a neural network for editing selfies in a photorealistic fashion, has updated its iOS and Android apps to what it’s calling FaceApp 2.0 — further fleshing out its monetization play with a Pro version that contains a series of selfie styling/beautifying filters.
The app became a bit of a viral hit earlier this year, off the back of a set of free filters that let people radically change the appearance of a selfie or portrait photo, including adding a toothy smile, switching genders, and dialing age appearance way up or way down.
It also ran into some race controversy over a ‘hotness’ filter which had originally been included in the app, after people found it was lightening skin tone as one of its ‘beautifying’ effects — leading to accusations of prejudice.
The founder subsequently apologized for what he described as an “unfortunate side-effect of the underlying neural network caused by the training set bias” — and the offending filter was renamed, while the team worked on a fix.
v2 of the app still includes a selection of free filters (though no longer a ‘hotness’ filter), grouped together under the heading “fun”. There’s also a new section called ‘Style’, which requires a Pro upgrade.
The face-altering effects being offered here are more obviously aimed at burnishing and beautifying the appearance of selfies, which FaceApp is hoping people will be willing to pay for, including a “makeup” filter and a “hipster”, goatee-adding option.
v2 of the app also includes support for face-morphing full-size photos, and a refreshed UI.

“Before this update, you could upgrade to the Pro version to get some extra features (e. g. remove watermarks) and turn off ads,” notes founder and CEO Yaroslav Goncharov. “The feedback we got is that there are a lot of people that are ready to pay for our app but expect to get new filters in return.”
Goncharov won’t disclose any new usage metrics for FaceApp at this point, but says since its initial release in January it’s had more than 45 million downloads.
Whether many users can be convinced to shell out for a few selfie beautifying effects remains to be seen, as there are a lot of existing apps that offer such effects — including multiple makeup apps/apps for smoothing and softening skin tone, and/or giving you a stylized cute/kawaii look (e.g. long-time Chinese app Meitu).
Whereas FaceApp grabbed initial attention for the novelty of its more radical alterations, such as a gender swapping feature which has led to the strange (and sometimes) public pass of men longing to meet their female selves. And women creating female versions of leading men in the Trump administration…
Clearly these novelty filters have helped raise FaceApp’s profile. It’s less clear whether a reputation for silly and/or uncanny valley neural network effects will translate into lots of paying customers for rather more subtle selfie alterations.
We also haven’t had a chance to test out FaceApp’s new style features, so can’t assess how well they stack up against existing selfie beautifying apps. The hipster goatee does at least sound a bit different — if not necessarily something lots of people would be willing to pay for. Especially as pricing for Pro looks pretty steep; it’s listed as $20. (Update: $19.99 is for a lifetime subscription; there’s also a $1.99 monthly subscription; or $9.99 per year option.)
Asked if they are confident they’ve fully fixed the race controversy issue, Goncharov says that avoiding the pitfall of algorithmic bias is something that requires ongoing attention.
“When dealing with such complex algorithms and neural networks, it would be naive and even irresponsible to declare such an issue completely fixed. It is an ongoing process,” he tells TechCrunch.
“What I can say is that we are committed to keeping this issue in mind at all phases of our product cycle from creating datasets and training neural networks to quality assurance and processing customer feedback. Our style filters designed to preserve ethnicity origin and our tests show that they do this quite well.”",2017-08-04,1523493,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/p1050609.jpg?w=738,europe/,"faceapp,neural-networks,internet-culture,selfie",FaceApp adds paid selfie styling effects,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/04/faceapp-adds-paid-selfie-styling-effects/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"At first glance, YC-backed Muzmatch‘s dating app might look best described as a ‘Tinder for Muslims’. But co-founders Shahzad Younas and Ryan Brodie are clear about what sets their target audience apart from the casual dating/hook-up crowd: a genuine intent to find a partner in order to get married.
Which is why, they say, they’re definitely not just cloning Tinder for Muslims.
“Our audience is super captivated, they’re so invested in this search,” says Brodie. “For a Muslim in their twenties, their upbringing has been so centered to find a husband or wife. And that is for most Muslims. I think some people think it’s just like JCrush for Jews. But it’s totally not about that from where we stand.
“Not just market size — we’re more than 100 times larger market than the Jewish market, for example — but the real difference is the seriousness and intent. It’s not casual dating. In Islam there’s a concept where… you’re only ever going to be half way there without your spouse. So this is how central it is. This is where almost all our users come at it from.”
Some two years after the launch of the first version of the app, Muzmatch has around 200,000 users, spread across ~160 countries, and is growing around 10 per cent, month on month, according to the co-founders.
“We’ve had weddings across the world,” says Younas. “Right now about 30 people a day are leaving our app and telling us specifically I found my partner on your app or I just got engaged or we just got married.”

Growth thus far has coming organically, via word-of-mouth recommendations in the Muslim community, they say. Around half of Muzmatch users are in the UK; around a third are in the US and Canada; with the rest spread all over the world. Gender wise, roughly two-thirds of are male, and one-third is female. The average age is mid to late twenties.
The founders say the matchmaking app has led to around 6,000 couples getting together so far — and “at least 600 confirmed weddings” — although they can’t be sure the number isn’t higher as not everyone messages them with their stories.
They tell a funny story about how they were emailed by a man from Uganda thanking them for helping him meet his wife via the app — and when they went to check exactly how many users they had in Uganda it was, well, just those two. “When it’s meant to be, it is meant to be!” says Younas.
Despite a few ‘rest of world’ successes to point to, their current “concentrated focus” is on Muslims in the West — tackling what they describe as the “key problem” for this 60-million community: “low density of Muslims”. Which means that Muslim singles searching for a partner of the same faith in towns and cities in places like the UK, US and Canada are likely to face a shortage of potential mates. At least in their immediate vicinity.
These dynamics work in Muzmatch’s favor, reckons Brodie, because their target market is already geared up to putting in extra work to find ‘the one’. And is also therefore likely to appreciate a tech tool that helps make their search easier.
“What’s great for us is there’s already an expectation of movement, so we’ve never had to worry about the network effect. Most dating apps, every user expects to meet the one a mile down the road — luckily for us, that expectation isn’t there, which is brilliant,” he tells TechCrunch.
Another advantage of addressing such an engaged user base, according to the founders, is Muzmatch’s singles are incentivized to fill out their profiles with lots of detailed information — given how many criteria can be at play as part of their search (i.e. over and above just whether they find a potential partner attractive, and relating to other factors such as family, culture, tradition, religious level and so on) — and the app can then utilize all this rich user data for improving its suggested matches.
“With our app, and with the technology in the app, we’re really trying to cater to those specific needs,” says Younas, describing the difficulties Muslims in the West can have meeting a person who meets all their criteria. “We think that conventional Western dating apps don’t really cater to this.”
The business is already profitable, taking revenue including via premium subscriptions and in-app purchases which offer users additional features, such as the ability to be matched with someone before they’ve liked you (as a way to try to get their attention) — though it’s free to join and use the basic app.
“Because there’s a more serious intent, people are more willing to spend vs… a casual dating app — where the expectation is almost free,” argues Younas.
And while Muzmatch’s feature-set has some basic mechanisms that would be familiar to any Tinder user, like the ability to ‘like’ or ‘pass’ on a possible match, and the ability to chat in-app with mutual matches, it also has differences that reflect the needs of its community — which Younas describes as being “essentially” without a casual dating market, as a result of marriage being “such a big part of our faith”.
So, for example, all users have to take a selfie via the app so their profile can be manually verified to help boost trust and keep out spammers; users don’t have to provide their real name though, and can choose not to display photos on their profiles or blur photos unless there’s an active match.
Users are also asked to rate others they have interacted with — and these ratings are fed into the matching algorithm, with the aim of surfacing “quality users” and promoting positive behaviors that mesh well with a community of singles that’s typically really serious about finding a life partner.
Female users can also opt for a chaperoning feature whereby all of their in-app chats are emailed to a wali/guardian, should they wish to observe this type of Islamic etiquette.
There are a few other differences in how males and females experience the app, such as women having more granular controls over who can see their photos, and being able to view more profiles per day before being capped (this is on account of there currently being more male users, say the founders).
“It’s transparent to both sides,” says Younas of the wali/guardian option. “So both parties in that conversation know that there’s a third party involved. And for us these are optional features we give to our users — depending on where they’re at, we don’t necessarily want to push a religious angle on people, but what we want to do is give them the option. So if you’re very religiously inclined you can pick these options.”
“For us being accessible to everyone is really the key to owning this market,” he adds. “There’s 1.8 billion Muslims across the world, and they’re very diverse — in culture, in language, in their outlooks, in particular religious etiquette, so what we’re trying to do is navigate all of that in a very — I wouldn’t necessarily say neutral way — but in a very accessible way to everybody… And so far it’s been working.”
The founders say they are intentionally making an effort to discourage the transactional dynamic that can creep into dating apps like Tinder — so, for instance, there are limits on the number of profiles a user can swipe through in a 12 hour period (although users can also pay to remove the cap); and people can also go back and revisit profiles they previously passed on, or rematch with people they previously unmatched if they change their mind later.
“We’ve actually had many examples of now married couples that have actually gone back and changed their minds,” says Brodie. “Unlike say on Tinder you can actually rematch someone. So you can unmatch if it didn’t work out and then in case six months later, something’s changed… you can rematch them.”
“We had a girl message us saying thank god for the rematch feature — because I wouldn’t have got with this guy if you didn’t have it,” adds Younas. “So we know this stuff works.”
Younas boostrapped and built the initial app himself, having — as a young Muslim in London — been unimpressed with the quality of existing Muslim dating websites, which he describes as “ugly and horrible”, and having a “terrible reputation”.
Brodie came on board later, after meeting Younas and being excited by the early traction for the MVP — and the pair relaunched Muzmatch last August.
With growing ambitions, they say they started to feel London was not the ideal base to try to scale a consumer app. Hence they applied and got onto Y Combinator’s program — and will be graduating in the 2017 summer batch of YC startups.
“Our ambitions have grown and grown and grown,” says Brodie. “We realized the opportunity we have here and we thought, in London at least, we weren’t going to get the ammo that we needed or the thoughts and the beliefs that you have in the West Coast of America… [YC] has got an incredible track record so we just thought let’s do this.”
While they’ve started with Muslims living in the West, their ambitions scale to the global Muslim market as a whole — seeing big potential to grow beyond their first focus on markets with a low density of Muslims.
Indeed, Brodie argues there’s even more need for a matchmaking app in majority Muslim countries which he says already have big but — as he sees it — ineffective and often expensive matchmaking industries. So, in other words, a high density of potential mates is still a problem for a matchmatching app to fix.
“There’s already a huge market of matchmakers [in countries like Indonesia]. But it’s incredibly ineffective,” he argues. “It’s not just a problem in the West, where there’s low density, even in a country where everyone’s a Muslim, as is the case for everyone, finding partners is very difficult.”
In terms of competition, and setting aside the older generation of matchmaking websites, Brodie says there are a “few” others trying to build dating apps for Muslim singles — a quick search on the App Store brings up Minder and Salaam-Swipe as just two examples — but claims Muzmatch is at least twice as big as “our nearest app competitor”.
“Our competitors are going about this completely the wrong way,” he argues. “They are essentially repackaging Tinder for Muslims which we know just doesn’t work and is why our competition has really bad credibility in the community.”
“The key for us is we’ve tried to go about this with an understanding of the Muslim culture and the particular quirks and sensibilities in terms of how they find a partner,” adds Younas.
“And this is why, for a lot of Muslims, Western dating apps don’t work because it doesn’t really cater to that particular need and intent. So, for us, from the beginning we’ve really thought about that, and ingrained that into our design and into our product. And we think, long term, that will set us apart.”
The founders also reckon Muzmatch might stand a better chance than typical dating apps of monetizing beyond the business of matching and dating itself — by offering related services, such as, for example, helping users find a wedding venue. Which may be important if their users are pairing up and getting married relatively quickly.
“I think we have a better chance than most to achieve monetization post-match. Because just the [short] timespan [between Muslims finding a partner and getting married] and the relationship with us is so close to the events unfolding I think, longer term, this might be an interesting space for us,” says Brodie.
“Right now the Muslim market is huge, so we’re not going to run out of customers,” adds Younas.
As they head into YC demo day, the pair are looking to raise funding but Younas says they intend to “tread carefully”, given Muzmatch is already profitable — the aim is to raise to “really accelerate things but on a more sustainable level”, he says.
They want to invest in areas such as localization and growing the size of the team (from currently just the two of them), so any funding will be going towards preparing for future growth, such as by investing in headcount and backend infrastructure.
“We have global ambitions,” says Younas. “We’re not just looking at the US, Canada and the UK. We really want to be the global player for Muslims worldwide looking for a partner.”
“Without a doubt, in ten years’ time, someone will have achieved this. We want to achieve this — and part of this raise will be making sure we have the ammo to really go for it,” adds Brodie. “We’re not just a niche dating app. This is totally different.
“This is a unique product, for 1.8 billion people… Half of the world’s population of Muslims are under thirty. In countries like Saudi Arabia, two-thirds of their population are under thirty. The growth in Muslim population across the world is phenomenal.”",2017-08-03,1523001,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/p1050607.jpg?w=738,europe/,"social-software,dating",YC-backed Muzmatch definitely doesn’t want to be Tinder for Muslims,tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/yc-backed-muzmatch-definitely-doesnt-want-to-be-tinder-for-muslims/
Mike Butcher,Europe,"Mobile publishers tend to struggle to optimise ad revenue and fill their mobile inventory, despite the abundance of options. What’s required is a one-stop solution for ad revenue optimisation that is simple to integrate and manage.
That’s the potential prospect with the acquisition today of French founded company AdinCube, in a deal claimed to be worth $20m. This is an AI-powered ‘in-app mediation technology’ which claims to predict supply and demand. It’s acquirer is Mozoo, a london-based mobile monetisation specialist.
Mozoo is essentially self-funded and growth has been driven by profitability. It did not raise funds to finance the deal, it borrowed money from banks (BNP Paribas and BPI France) and historical angel investors including Very and Alclan.
Mozoo received one round of seed investment back in 2011, which was less than a million. The $20m figure is comprised of upfront and earn outs in debt and convertibles. The rest, approximately 30% of the total, comes from shares of Mozoo. AdinCube had raised $1M “Non Equity Assistance”.
However, the deal mirrors another acquisition of a former YC company last year, Heyzap, which had raised $8 million in total, and was acquired by Germany company RNTS Media, for up to $45 million. As well as the old Heyzap, competitors for AdinCube the include Appodeal and AddAptr.
Mozoo says the the acquisition will enable it to significantly enhance its in-app monetisation offer on a global scale – providing publishers with full clarity and control over their ad revenue.
AdinCube’s optimisation technology is said to be pretty powerful. Etienne Rugeri (co-founder, CTO) spent six years of his career working for chartered airlines, optimising crucial operations and building business applications for pilots, before moving into ad-tech. Among many projects, Rugeri built automated platforms that would optimise fuel consumption for aircraft, statistically analysing the previous 2 years fuel usage to assist crews in deciding how much fuel to take on board for a certain journey, considering all possible variables.
Thus, AdinCube’s SDK uses predictive optimisation algorithms and multi -level machine learning to accurately predict the future – analysing every available demand source, buying metric, creative format and ad network in real-time.",2017-08-03,1523068,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/nanigans-mobile-ads.png?w=428,europe/,,"Mozoo acquires AdinCube, to create one ad platform for mobile publishers",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/mozoo-acquires-adincube-to-create-one-ad-platform-for-mobile-publishers/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Personio, a German startup that offers a HR management and recruiting platform, has closed $12 million in Series A funding. European VC Northzone led the round, with participation from existing investors, such as Rocket Internet’s Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Picus Capital. The Munich-based company plans to use the funding to further develop its Software-as-a-Service and become a leader in the HR software space for small and medium-sized (SME) companies.
Founded in 2015 and “bootstrapped” to nearly 100 customers in the first one and a half years, before taking a seed round from Global Founders Capital and a few business angels last summer, Personio now claims over 400 customers and counts over 50 employees. SMEs use the platform to manage all of their HR and recruitment processes, benefiting from what the startup describes as a single view of employee management.
“On the highest level we are digitizing HR and Recruiting for SMEs to reduce administrative workload and allow HR managers to work on value-adding topics,” Personio co-founder and CEO Hanno Renner tells TechCrunch. “More specifically we are building an end-to-end HR Operating System that covers all processes along the employee life-cycle (recruit, manage and develop)”
The result is described by Renner as a “central hub for all HR data,” and is seeing the company take a platform approach by integrating with vertical players in the HR space to provide customers with “the ease of only having to track information about their people at one place and then pushing them via our API”.
Concrete examples of areas covered by Personio include: a full applicant tracking system, with support for multi-posting to over 100 job boards (e.g. Stepstone, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc); a digital employee file; document and contract management; on/off-boarding; attendance tracking; absence management; salary management & payroll; and performance management and feedback.
Renner says that typical Personio customers are European companies between 10 and 1,000 employees. “However, our core segment is between 100-500 employees. Typical examples would be HelloFresh, Statista or Scalable Capital,” he adds.
Competitors are cited as Excel and paper-based files. Or more directly, European HR platforms, such as HiBob or HeavenHR, which have more of a focus towards employee benefits (similar to Zenefits in the U.S.). Instead, Renner says Personio is starting earlier in the employee life-cycle including recruiting, and provides a seamless transition of successful applicants into the HRM section.
“A lot of our customers have therefore replaced for example BambooHR and Jobvite to have everything in one tool. Besides the all-in-one approach, our main differentiator is customisability of all processes as well as a strong focus on data privacy which is critical given the sensitive information our customers store in Personio,” he adds.
Unlike many of the other new HR startups, which offer their wares for free but make money selling benefits and insurances, Personio is employing a classic SaaS-subscription model. In addition, the company has a secondary revenue stream from multi-posting on job boards and other integrations.",2017-08-03,1522598,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/personio-founder.jpg?w=738,europe/,personio,"Personio, a HR startup in Munich, closes $12M Series A",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/personio/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"Fitness tracker makers would have you believe that all that stands between you and the motivation to get up off your couch and get healthy is their shiny wearable device.
But a new study conducted by researchers in the UK suggests that, in some circumstances, fitness wearables can end up doing the opposite: becoming a de-motivating factor, after the initial novelty of wearing a tracker wears off.
Researchers at Brunel University London the University of Birmingham conducted an eight-week study to investigate whether fitness wearables could encourage young teenagers to take more exercise.
Their study focused on school pupils, aged 13 to 14, with participants split nearly equally between genders (44 girls and 40 boys), and recruited from two different schools in the north and south of the UK. The teenagers were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge wristband for eight weeks; to use the Fitbit app; and to take part in surveys and focus groups, before and after the trial period ended, responding to questions about how they felt about exercising and using the device.
The researchers had expected the wearable to have a positive impact on encouraging teens to exercise across a range of different forms of motivation, as well as hypothesizing it would help avoid kids feeling demotivated about physical activity.
However, while the researchers record an initial “novelty” bump in interest in physical activity among some participants “for the first few weeks”, the results of the full study were the opposite of encouraging — with participants overall reporting feeling less confident about their competence at exercising, and ultimately discouraged from doing so.
“It was consistently reported that after about 4 weeks pupils became bored with the Fitbit,” the researchers write. “This evidence suggests that though the Fitbit serves to promote physical activity, for the pupils in this study, the Fitbit may have only produced modest and short-term effects.”
Fitbit’s non-personalized 10,000 steps per day target, for example, was cited as an unfair and pressurizing goal by study participants — generating feelings of guilt or lack of ability among users, which in turn acted as a disincentive for taking more exercise.
Study participants also reported feeling like they had less choice over how to engage in physical activity — which also ended up being a demotivating factor.
While pressure from competition with peers, encouraged via in-app comparison in a social leaderboard scenario, also ultimately negatively impacted participants’ motivation to exercise.
“Data from this study demonstrated that though clear potential exists, healthy lifestyle technologies negatively impact young people’s motivation for physical activity,” the researchers write. “Competition, peer comparison and social comparison to normative predetermined targets result in only short-term motivational effects.”
In their paper they reference a framework of motivational behavior in youth physical activity, called self-determination theory, which proposes that individuals are optimally motivated if they are making changes fully of their own volition, and therefore internalizing the rational for doing so and satisfying core psychological needs; vs responding to feelings of “controlled motivation” — be it to avoid feelings of guilt or obtain social approval, or else gain a reward or avoid a punishment.
And while the researchers note that Fitbit’s wearable does include features that could, at least in theory, help support youngsters’ “basic psychological needs” to be self-motivated to exercise — citing features such as elements within the app that allow goal setting, give feedback on performance, and messaging features, for example — in practice the study found that Fitbit’s non-personalized goals ended up imposing overly exacting standards of social comparison on participants.
And that pressure over peer-group competition and standardized goals squeezed out any potential for the Fitbit to support more sustained motivation for individual youngsters.
“Our data suggests that peer-comparison was a key factor in undermining levels of competence and autonomous motivation. There wasn’t a desire for our participants to be more active for themselves and their own goals, or for fun, it was simply because they wanted to beat their mates,” said study author, Dr Charlotte Kerner, in a statement.
“Self-determined forms of motivation are much better in encouraging people to engage in a particular behaviour,” she added.
Despite the negative findings, the researchers suggest digital technologies could still play a useful role in encouraging exercise among young people — if they are coupled with support and guidance to help “educate young people in personalisation and interpreting data for individual goals and ability, rather than encouraging young people to compare themselves to others or a normative standard of achievement”.
They also emphasize the importance of autonomy in motivating young people to be more physically active.
“Young people need to see themselves as capable and confident, and the ‘origin’ of their behaviours rather than a ‘pawn’,” they add.
The study, entitled The Motivational Impact of Wearable Healthy Lifestyle Technologies: A Self-determination Perspective on Fitbits With Adolescents, is published in the American Journal of Health Education.
We reached out to Fitbit for comment on the study — we’ll update this story with any response. Update: The company declined to provide a statement but a spokeswoman suggested that as the study did not assess actual physical activity levels it’s not possible to draw conclusions about actual impact on physical activity.
She further noted that Fitbit users can customize all their health and fitness goals, including the 10,000 steps goal — although the wider point there is that having a default goal creates an expectation and risks setting up a de facto standard across a social group, regardless of whether individuals can customize their own goals.",2017-08-02,1522458,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/p8222698.jpg?w=738,europe/,"tracker,wearable-technology,activity-tracker,wearable-devices","Fitbit turns teens off exercising, study finds",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/fitbit-turns-teens-off-exercising-study-finds/
Natasha Lomas,Europe,"The UK’s Home Secretary has yet again cranked up the pressure on messaging giants over use of end-to-end encryption to secure communications sent via popular services like WhatsApp — implying she would prefer tech companies voluntarily re-engineer their security systems so that decrypted data can be handed over to terror-fighting intelligence agencies on demand.
Writing in a paywalled opinion article, published in the Telegraph yesterday, Rudd wheels out the now familiar political refrain that use of e2e encryption is hampering intelligence and law enforcement agencies, before going on to apply such twisted logic it’s hard not to conclude she’s deploying some kind of proprietary crypto of her own, i.e. which scrambles words into incomprehensible nonsense — enabling her to claim to support and value “strong encryption” whilst simultaneously calling for tech giants to work with her to undermine encrypted communications.
“To be very clear — the government supports strong encryption and has no intention of banning end-to-end encryption. But the inability to gain access to encrypted data in specific and targeted instances — even with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State and a senior judge — is right now severely limiting our agencies’ ability to stop terrorist attacks and bring criminals to justice,” she writes, before going on to suggest that:
1) “real people” (whoever they are) aren’t interested in ensuring the privacy of their communications;
2) e2e encryption can be compromised without the need for a backdoor;
Quoth Rudd:
It really is not clear what “reality” Rudd occupies when she writes that e2e encryption is only e2e encryption in “theory”. Unless she intends to imply that a security system could, in fact, contain a backdoor which enables access to decrypted data — in which case it would not be e2e encryption (yet she also specifically claims she’s not asking companies to “break encryption” or “create so called “”back doors”” so there’s plenty to scratch your head about here).
Asked for thoughts on Rudd’s comments on encryption, WhatsApp parent Facebook declined to comment. And, frankly, who can blame it? When a message is so knotted with bizarre claims, contradictions and logical fallacies the only sensible response is to stay silent.
On the one hand Rudd is saying that billions of people use WhatsApp because it’s “incredibly user-friendly”, while at the same time claiming that robust security is too difficult for “real people” to use. (Historically she may have had a point — yet, today, billions of “real” WhatsApp users are sending billions of e2e encrypted messages, each and every day, and apparently not finding this task overly arduous.)
“It appears that the Home Secretary’s greatest fear is software that is both secure AND usable. How sad,” said security research Alec Muffett, a former Facebook employee who worked on deploying e2e crypto for its ‘Secret Conversations’ feature, when asked for his thoughts on Rudd’s comments.
If you aim for a really cynical interpretation, you could say that Rudd is only saying she’s not asking companies to stop using e2e encryption; i.e. she’s implying they voluntarily don’t need to use e2e because “real people” aren’t bothered about the privacy of their comms anyway — ergo, tech giants are free to ditch those pesky e2e crypto systems that so annoy governments without suffering any backlash from users (and — crucially from her PoV — without the government being accused of literally “banning” encryption).
The phrase “trade-offs between security and “usability”” is an interesting one for her to choose, though. It brings to mind a specific security controversy pertaining to WhatsApp’s platform earlier this year, after The Guardian reported claims by a security researcher that he’d identified a “backdoor” in WhatsApp’s crypto — a claim WhatsApp vigorously denied. (The claim was also junked by a very long list of security researchers, and The Guardian went on to amend its story to remove the word “backdoor” — before ultimately publishing a review of the original, in its words, “flawed reporting”.)
The “retransmission vulnerability” the Guardian’s report had couched as a “backdoor” was in fact a “design decision”, said WhatsApp, which explained that it prioritizes message reliability for its very large user-base, meaning it will still deliver a message when a key has changed — offering the option for users to turn on a specific security notification to alert them to a potential risk of their communications having been compromised.
“The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks,” it said in a statement at the time.
How WhatsApp handles key retransmission was described as “a small and unlikely threat”, by academic Zeynep Tufekci, who organized an open letter denouncing the Guardian’s original report. The letter, addressed to the newspaper, asserted: “The behavior you highlight is a measured tradeoff that poses a remote threat in return for real benefits that help keep users secure.”
It’s possible that Rudd, and/or the intelligence and law enforcement agencies she liaises with, has picked up on these sorts of ‘usability vs security’ trade-off discussions, and is viewing design decisions that prioritize things like reliability ahead of “perfect, unbreakable security”, as she puts it, as offering a potential route for enacting some kind of targeted and limited interception, i.e. even when a platform has otherwise deployed strong encryption.
Albeit, Rudd is also saying the “options” she spies to “get more information on what serious criminals and terrorists are doing online” nonetheless rely on “mature conversations between the tech companies and the government” — hence repeating her call for both sides to “work together”.
Confidentiality ensures there will be no public discussion about what exactly tech giants and governments might be agreeing to do, collectively and individually, to harvest the online activity of particular targets — although the risk for messaging platforms that sell services as strongly encrypted (and therefore give users an expectation of robust privacy), is every time these companies are seen to meet with government representatives their users might feel moved to wonder about the substance of their behind-closed-doors discussions. Which risks undermining user trust in their claims.
Asked for thoughts on what “options” Rudd might be trying to articulate here, Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University, told TechCrunch: “With “usabililty vs security trade-offs” she has once again picked up a meaningful phrase and applied it out of context. WhatsApp end-to-end encryption is a usability success story, as its users barely notice it while gaining some level of security. Some level only — as Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook pointed out to UK government recently, by saying that WhatsApp communications metadata (who talks to whom, and when) can still be shared, and is likely still extremely useful for law enforcement.”
“[Rudd] is publicly putting pressure on [Internet giants], possibly encouraged by how China managed to get Apple to stop offering VPN apps. Getting them to comply via legal means would be slow and invisible to the public eye, so this works much better,” he added.
Meanwhile, Rudd has another agenda that is at least far more explicit: Getting tech giants to speed up takedowns of terrorist propaganda that’s being publicly spread via their platforms.
And you could argue that applying political pressure over use of encryption is a way to grease the pipe of compliance for the related ‘online extremism’ takedowns issue.
The Home Secretary, who has been suggested as a potential successor to the current (embattled) UK Prime Minister, is certainly taking full advantage of the PR opportunities to raise her own profile as she tours tech giants’ HQs in Silicon Valley this week.
Here’s Rudd standing in front of a giant Google logo at the company’s Mountain View HQ — where she went to discuss “what can be done to reduce the availability of online terrorist content”…
And here she is getting a selfie with Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg who she was meeting to “discuss threat from terrorist use of the Internet”…
And here’s a photo of the Home Secretary in talks with a couple of unidentified Twitter staffers to hear “progress made to tackle terrorist content online and discuss further action needed”. (Presumably Jack was too busy for a photo call.)
Rudd has also vlogged about her intent to get tech companies to “take action together” to stop terrorists spreading extremist propaganda online.
This Home Office PR blitz is notable in not making explicit mention of e2e encryption. Rudd has apparently left that political push to the pages of a lesser read UK newspaper. Which feeds the idea she’s playing a few propaganda games of her own here.
While the bundling of the two political concerns (private terrorist/criminal comms; and public online extremism content) allows the government to obfuscate outcomes, spread blame and spin failures.
On the flip side, tech giants have been spinning up their own PR machines ahead of today’s debut workshop of the newly formed Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).
The initiative was announced in late June by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft to — as they put it — “help us continue to make our hosted consumer services hostile to terrorists and violent extremists”, specifically by sharing information and best practices with each other, government and NGOs. Other tech companies have since signed up.
GIFCT is of course a way for tech firms to share the burden — and if you want to be cynical, spread the blame — of responding to growing political pressure over online extremism which affects them all, albeit to greater and lesser degrees.
Facebook, Google and Twitter have all published the same blog post about the first meeting of the forum, in which they describe their joint “mission”, set out “strategies” and list a few near-term aims.
tl;dr no one can accuse Silicon Valley of doing nothing about online extremism now.
They write:
Also today, Google has a separate update on measures it’s applying on YouTube to “fight against online terrorism” — having faced a backlash from advertisers earlier this year the company arguably has even more reason to be seen to be taking action, and for those actions to be effective at stemming the loss of ad dollars.",2017-08-01,1521823,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/p1050602.jpg?w=738,europe/,"computer-security,end-to-end-encryption,cryptography,social-media",More political headbanging on encryption threatens privacy,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/more-political-headbanging-on-encryption-threatens-privacy/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"Plume Labs has been working on air pollution for a while. In addition to its mobile app and air quality device, the startup is launching a paid API called Plume.io so that anybody can add air quality to their own service. Think about it as Dark Sky’s API, but for air quality.
Plume Labs has designed its own algorithm to predict air pollution around the world. The company relies on 12,000 environmental monitoring stations in 60 countries. Many agencies and local authorities share air quality data.
The company then combines this data with other factors, such as the time of the day, weather conditions, weather forecasts, geographical specifics and human activities. Plume Labs can always compare its predictions with actual pollution levels by waiting and pulling data later in the day.
And it turns out that many companies would like to use this sort of forecast for air quality. That’s why the company is opening up its API to third-party companies. You can get data for Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) starting at $500 a month.
Many companies are interested in Plume.io, such as companies working on smart homes and smart cities, real estate companies, fitness companies, healthcare companies as well as cosmetics makers. And Plume Labs will also give free access to Plume.io to researchers, activists, etc.
“We believe that environmental health is deeply personal and an important emerging vertical for personal health and wellbeing, so our Air Report mobile app and our consumer air quality tracker will remain our core focus,” co-founder and CEO Romain Lacombe told me. “However more and more companies were reaching out to access our air quality forecasts, and opening the Plume API will give these corporate clients access to our advanced predictive platform. Working with API partners will also bring financial support to keep our core app free for consumers, and dramatically broaden our reach to raise awareness of the public health crisis of pollution.”
So if you’ve been using Plume Labs’ mobile app, it’s not going away any time soon. And you’ll also soon be able to pre-order a Flow, Plume Labs’ own device. Plume.io is just a new service for developers who need air quality data. In the future, Plume Labs would like to extend forecasting data beyond 24 hours and add other data points, such as pollen level.",2017-08-01,1521886,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/plume-api.png?w=738,europe/,"france-newsletter,plume-labs","Plume Labs launches Plume.io, an API for air pollution",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/plume-labs-launches-plume-io-an-api-for-air-pollution/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"LogMeIn, the company that provides authentication and other connectivity solutions for those who connect remotely to networks and services, has made another acquisition to expand the products it offers to customers, specifically in its new Bold360 CRM platform, launched in June. The company has picked up Nanorep, a startup out of Israel that develops chatbots and other AI-based tools to help people navigate self-service apps.
LogMeIn is paying $45 million plus up to $5 million more in earn-outs based on performance and employees staying put over the next two years.
Nanorep had raised just under $7 million from investors that included Titanium out of Russia (which had also backed Cloudyn, recently acquired by Microsoft), Oryzn Capital and OurCrowd.
The startup already had around 500 large customers, including big names like FedEx, Toys“R”Us and Vodafone. In essence, its platform helps anticipate what customers are trying to do when they’re on a website — say in a technical support or search situation — and reduces the number of steps needed to get there. It looks like all of Nanorep’s existing business will continue as its tech also gets integrated into Bold360.
LogMeIn’s launch of Bold360 earlier this year was intended to help the company expand the range of services that it offered to customers, beyond authentication and IT management within an organisation, and into more cloud-based services where the business interfaces with its customers.
However, the CRM space is already very crowded, and so it’s no surprise to see that LogMeIn has made an acquisition to add more features to the service to help set it apart from the pack.
With Nanorep, it’s also tapping into the recent enthusiasm and interest in AI and building “intelligent” services that mimic human behaviours, specifically in CRM.
“Artificial intelligence is changing the way we interact with our favorite brands and will play a critical role in the future of customer engagement,” said Bill Wagner, CEO, LogMeIn, in a statement. “With Nanorep, we gain proven technology and AI expertise that expands our Bold360 offering, accelerates our customer engagement vision and provides a natural path for us to leverage these emerging technologies across our entire portfolio. We believe in the ability of technology to unlock the potential of the modern workforce and with the addition of Nanorep we are going to be able to deliver solutions that will help our customers achieve the next generation of humanized and personalized customer service.”
Although LogMeIn has acquired Nanobot to help raise its game in CRM, on another level this is also an important move just to keep up.
Gartner predicts that “conversational agents” — which you can interpret as a more fancy way of saying “chatbots” — will account for 30 percent of all customer service interactions by 2022, up from just three percent today.
There are many others that are also active in this same area, including Salesforce with its Einstein AI, Gong, which provides real-time processing and teaching to live agents; and Hubspot, which just made an acquisition of its own, of Kemvi.
What Nanorep is tapping into that is interesting is the fact that the vast range of businesses in the world are not tech-centric, and so they will be less capable of building AI solutions like chatbots themselves, nor will they want to spend an arm and a leg to get them: like all software, AI is gradually moving into the realm of being off-the-shelf, and LogMeIn is hoping to be a part of that trend.
This is publicly traded LogMeIn’s seventh acquisition, and its first since acquiring password manager LastPass in 2015 for $110 million.",2017-08-01,1521830,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-621852420.jpg?w=738,europe/,"ai,crm,chatbots,logmein",LogMeIn acquires chatbot and AI startup Nanorep for up to $50M,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/logmein-acquires-chatbot-and-ai-startup-nanorep-for-up-to-50m/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Carspring, the London and Berlin used car buying platform founded by Rocket Internet, has picked up £5 million in Series B funding. Backing the round are Rocket Internet itself, along with Channel 4’s Commercial Growth Fund, which offers media in the form of TV advertising in return for equity. In other words, a portion of this round (£1.3m) isn’t cash per se. A number of other unnamed investors also participated.
Launched in 2015, Carspring is described as an online used car dealership and moves the buying process for a used car entirely online. On the supply side it sources used cars from a network of used car dealers, while the demand side sees it put in place numerous features to make buying online both trustworthy and extra convenient.
This includes mechanical checks to ensure vehicles makes the Carspring grade, a 6 month warranty on cars bought, home delivery, and a 14 day money-back guarantee — although I’m pretty sure the latter falls within distance selling regulation anyway. Either way, a big part of the startup’s pitch to consumers is that its processes can be trusted, with no or little downside buying a car online rather than in person. In addition, the company provides financing to let you buy your car through instalments.
The importance of putting weight behind the Carspring brand would also explain why the company is investing heavily in ‘above the line’ advertising and taking media-for-equity investment from Channel 4. While VCs are fine with significant dollars being spent on online marketing, which is highly targeted and trackable in terms of ROI, they aren’t always so keen on lots of their cash being sloshed on TV ads. Channel 4’s Commercial Growth Fund offers an alternative way for the right kinds of startups at the right stage to invest in and potentially benefit from television since only equity swaps hands.
To that end, in respect of Carspring, Vinay Solanki, Head of Channel 4’s Growth Fund, says he looks for “highly disruptive early stage companies” that are solving consumer problems but are not typically able to access TV advertising in their growth stage without help. We can also expect to see Carspring’s first TV ad campaign air in the not so distant future.",2017-08-01,1521427,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/carspring-platform-mobile.jpg?w=738,europe/,carspring,"Carspring, a London and Berlin startup that lets you buy a used car online, raises £5M Series B",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/carspring-2/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"Fintech startup Klarna grew thanks to its e-commerce payment service, but now the startup is diversifying a bit. The Swedish company is launching Wavy, a free peer-to-peer payment app and service.
After Cookies imploded, Klarna approached the team behind the German app so that they could join another fintech company. It turns out that this team has been working on another peer-to-peer payment app. And the fact that Klarna is backing this project makes it interesting as it’s a highly competitive space.
There are quite a few peer-to-peer payment apps out there, such as Venmo and Square Cash in the U.S., Lydia in France and Ireland, Circle, etc. Other fintech products also let you send money instantly for free, such as Revolut and N26. Finally, big players are also adding peer-to-peer payment features as part of their existing products, such as Apple with Apple Pay in iOS 11, or Facebook with Messenger in the U.S.
Wavy is trying a different approach because people are tired of downloading new apps, signing up and saving their credit card information everywhere — with Wavy, only one side of the transaction has to sign up. It works in 31 European countries already.
When you create a transaction using the app, Wavy generates a link. You can then share this link in any messaging app. It works in Whatsapp, Messenger, iMessage — anything you want. Your recipient can then click on this link to open a web page.
Your recipient can then accept and redeem the payment with a standard IBAN — no need to sign up. If you are requesting money, your recipient can put their credit card or debit card number. Once again, you don’t need an account. If your friend doesn’t click on the link, the transaction expires after a while. You can add animated stickers to your payment.
Wavy hopes that at least some people will download the app — you need an account to initiate a transaction after all. If people on your network sign up, you can tap on their names directly in the app without having to share a link in a messaging app. That’s how Wavy can create a viral loop.
But Wavy’s hidden weapon is that anyone with a Klarna account can activate Wavy in their settings. It could quickly become a hit in some markets where Klarna is particularly popular, such as Sweden.",2017-08-01,1521343,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/15.jpg?w=738,europe/,"cookies,klarna,wavy",Klarna launches a peer-to-peer payment app called Wavy,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/klarna-launches-a-peer-to-peer-payment-app-called-wavy/
Ingrid Lunden,Europe,"Large hotel chains are feeling the heat from Airbnb and other startups building digital marketplaces for travelers with a more flexible range of places to stay, and more flexible prices to match. And that is leading some of them to make acquisitions.
RCI, a division of Wyndham Worldwide, has acquired Love Home Swap, a startup out of London that lets people book time to stay in other people’s homes, while at the same time list their properties for people to book.
Wyndham is not revealing the terms of the deal, but we have learned from sources close to the deal that it is £40 million (just under $53 million) in cash. The company had raised about £12 million ($16 million) in funding.
Notably, as part of the deal, co-founder and CEO Debbie Wosskow is stepping down from her role leading the company and moving to an advisory position for the next six months. Her brother Ben, who co-founded the company with her, will step up as CEO.
Wosskow has been one of the more outspoken executives in the London tech community when it comes to advocating for a more diverse landscape of founders, and last year she and Anna Jones, the CEO of Hearst UK, formed AllBright a funding and education network geared to female entrepreneurs. Stepping away from the CEO role will give her more time to focus on that.
The deal is not the first time a large hotel chain has acquired a travel startup to move into the new wave of marketplaces. Last year, Accor Hotels paid $170 million to acquire OneFineStay, a would-be Airbnb competitor that focuses exclusively on high-end properties.
Meanwhile, Expedia was reportedly rebuffed in its attempt to acquire Luxury Retreats (another company focused on high-end properties that eventually was snapped up by Airbnb). In the meantime, it and Priceline have been pumping up their inventory of vacation rentals in an attempt to compete with Airbnb.
Love Home Swap is a logical acquisition for Wyndham’s RCI group. The larger company is famous for hotel chains like Travelodge and Ramada, but also has long had a business in self-catered and family accommodation. RCI is mainly focused on time-share exchanges (swapping one timeshare interval for another), and Wyndham has been in the business of private home rentals since 2001, with 120,000 properties. But RCI had not really moved into the complementary area of private home swaps, which is what Love Home Swap will give them.
“Since first pioneering the vacation exchange concept more than 40 years ago, RCI has continually found new ways to evolve and grow its own business while also propelling the exchange industry further,” said Gordon Gurnik, president of RCI. “Through this acquisition we expand the exchange options we offer travelers and strengthen our footprint in key growth markets across the globe.”
The Love Home Swap deal is a far cry from the numbers that float around Airbnb, which is reportedly heading for an IPO, and has raised more than $1 billion and is now valued at $31 billion.
Nevertheless, it underscores a large swing in the hotel industry for the bigger and more established companies — be they large hotel chains or the megaliths that control the vast amount of hotel bookings online. They are all buying up and investing in some of the smaller upstarts to help position themselves for the next stage of competition.
Airbnb feels unstoppable now, and its moves into areas like flight booking, vacation planning and other services adjacent to accommodation are gradually making it more likely that it will soon be able to close (and control) the travel loop completely. In that regard, Wyndham’s move feels less a threat, as it is a sign of how the big owner of Ramada, Super 8, Travelodge, Howard Johnson, Wyndham Hotels and more is coming along for the ride.
Updated to note that RCI is part of Wyndham Worldwide, not Wyndham Hotel Group; and that RCI’s business is primarily focused on time share swaps, not time shares.",2017-07-31,1521505,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/127879664.jpg?w=738,europe/,"travel,hotels,love-home-swap",Wyndham buys Love Home Swap for $53M,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/wyndham-hotel-group-buys-love-home-swap-for-53m/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Lost My Name, the London-based startup that uses tech to create and publish personalised story books for children, has raised $8.5 million in Series B funding. It is also revealing an upcoming tie-in with the Roald Dahl Estate, owners of IP such as Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory.
The round was led by Ravensburger, a leading European publisher of games, puzzles, and children’s books, so it’s a strategic investment of sorts. Existing investors, Google Ventures, Project A Ventures, Greycroft, The Chernin Group, and Allen & Co, also participated. I understand part of the round is a venture debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank, too.
In related news, Lost My Name’s name is lost no more. The startup (not so) quietly re-branded last week as “Wonderbly,” a move that is likely part of a bid to move beyond the company’s original title and only ‘hit’ so far, the wonderful “The Little Boy/Girl Who Lost His/Her Name,” which has sold over 2.7 million copies and claims to be the leading picture book in the markets Wonderbly operates.
Co-founder and CEO Asi Sharabi told me during a catch up call last week that the company has created six new products this year, with more to come. And most impressively, Wonderbly has signed a partnership with the Roald Dahl Estate.
The Joint-IP project will see the two organisations work together to “open the gates” of Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, presumably via some kind of book infused with clever use of data and personalisation. I, for one, can’t wait.
The project also ties into what Sharabi told me last year when he said the startup was actively seeking to partner with outside creatives and companies, as it opens up the platform. “Technology and business models scale but creativity doesn’t,” he said at the time.
IP as loved as Willy Wonka, on the other hand, is infinitely scalable, so this, along with today’s funding, is a nice win for Wonderbly, a company I’ve always thought needed patient capital rather than bucket loads of move fast, break things-styled VC.
That’s something Sharabi doesn’t dispute either, citing the startup’s investment mantra as “added value over capital,” and pressing home that Ravensburger brings over 100 years of operational experience in the children’s entertainment space.
As we wrapped up our call, I asked him how he managed to successfully pitch the Roald Dahl Estate, and he revealed that they actually reached out to him. The organisation was on the look out for new creative opportunities beyond its recent ventures into Hollywood and the newly-named Wonderbly seemed just the golden ticket.",2017-07-31,1521487,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/wonderbly-company-photo-1-2.jpg?w=738,europe/,lost-my-name,"Lost My Name, the tech-driven kids book publisher, raises $8.5M and partners with Roald Dahl Estate",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/wonderbly/
Jon Russell,Apps,"The Chinese government’s crackdown on the internet continues with the news that Apple has removed all major VPN apps, which help internet users overcome the country’s censorship system, from the App Store in China.
The move was first noted by ExpressVPN, a provider based outside of China, which said in a blog post “all major VPN apps” including its own had been purged from Apple’s China-based store. The company shared a note from Apple (below) explaining that its app was removed because “it includes content that is illegal in China.”
The app continues to be available for users across the world outside of China, the company said. However, the process to create an App Store account in a different country is unknown to many users, so it is unlikely to fill the void of the missing Chinese app.
Another provide, Star VPN, tweeted that its app had also been removed.
Apple had not replied for comment at the time of writing. In a statement issued later it said it was “required” to remove the apps because they violate Chinese law.

The App Store purge is hugely impactful because VPNs represent the only way that a China-based individual can bypass state censorship controls to access the internet without restrictions. The Chinese government effectively illegalized VPNs when new rules issued in January required them to receive government approval in order to operate. That appears to be why Apple was forced to remove ExpressVPN and others like it.
Apple may believe it is best for its business to co-operate with requests from Beijing, but this App Store purge just created one of the biggest setbacks for the free internet in China’s history.
“We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts. ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties,” ExpressVPN wrote on its blog.
Today’s news is the latest in a series of developments against the free internet from China.
Two popular VPN services were forced offline in China earlier this month leaving their users, which included professionals who require access to the global internet for work, without an alternative. Government officials denied a story from Bloomberg that the country’s mobile operators had been told to ban VPN apps by early 2018, but other steps have clearly been taken. Reuters reported earlier this month that the Great Firewall, the term for China’s internet censorship apparatus, had been “upgraded” with new capabilities. VPN services subsequently found that they had been hit by the most sophisticated attacks from China to date. High-end hotels have even ceased offer VPNs to guests.
Those new capability apparently also made it possible for the government to interfere with messaging apps. While now blocked entirely, WhatsApp users found that they were unable to send videos and photos through the chat app and issues seemed to extend to WeChat, China’s most popular messaging service. The censorship seemed to be linked to the response to the death of dissident Liu Xiaobo, a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, who lost a battle to liver cancer earlier this month having been denied permission to leave custody to seek medical treatment overseas.
Going direct to Apple is becoming an effective way to enforce censorship since the U.S. firm controls what apps are available in China. The tactic proved successful for China earlier this year when Apple removed the New York Times app from the local Chinese App Store. The Times and Wall Street Journal are among a number of international news sites blocked in China, according to censorship monitoring service Great Fire.
It’s unclear whether similar action has been taken with Android stores in China. The Google Play Store is not present in China, where a handful of third-party app stores are the most influential distributors of Android apps.
Not-for-profit group GreatFire offers ‘censorship-proof’ alternatives like its Android VPN FreeBrowser and other services that include a collaboration with The New York Times, but Apple’s iOS doesn’t permit similar options.
Apple just announced Isabel Ge Mahe as the first managing director for its Chinese business and, beyond battling a sales slump in China, the long-time Apple executive is tasked with the difficult job of managing a relationship with Beijing. The U.S. firm recently announced plans to develop its first China-based data center, a move that is thought to be related to the country’s new cybersecurity laws which went into effect June 1.",2017-07-29,1521006,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/apple-china.jpg?w=738,asia/,"technology,computing,apple-inc,internet-censorship",Apple removes VPN apps from the App Store in China,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/29/apple-removes-vpn-apps-from-the-app-store-in-china/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Expedia is deepening its focus on Southeast Asia after it invested $350 million in Traveloka, an online travel portal based out of Indonesia.
A source close to the deal confirmed that the investment values Traveloka at more than $1 billion. That means the startup has joined the likes of Grab, Sea (formerly Garena), Go-Jek and Lazada in the region’s unicorn club.
Expedia said it has picked up a “minority” stake in the company. Alongside its investment, it disclosed that Traveloka has also raised an additional $150 million over the past year from other investors, including East Ventures, Hillhouse Capital Group, JD.com and Sequoia Capital.
Traveloka was founded in Indonesia in 2012, and today it services Southeast Asia’s six primary markets — Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines. The startup previously raised seed funding rounds from East Ventures and Rocket Internet’s Global Founders Capital, but its most recent public round was way back in 2013.
Beyond new capital, Traveloka has partnered with Expedia to add international hotel accommodation beyond Asia to its platform.
Southeast Asia boasts a population of 600 million people, with rapidly growing internet access and smartphone sales giving it real potential as a tech market. A 2016 report co-authored by Google forecast that the region’s internet economy will grow 6.5-fold from $31 billion in 2015 to $197 billion in 2025.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has secured a $1 billion loan in order to develop its international focus and build out its offline sales presence.
The company revealed today that it has secured a three-year syndicated loan agreement from 18 banks across Europe, Middle East, India, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley served as joint global coordinator, with Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, and Wing Lung Bank.
The company previously raised a loan in 2014, months before it raised a $1 billion venture capital round at a valuation of $45 billion. There’s no suggestion that it is about to raise money from investors now, however.
The loan is aimed at furthering Xiaomi’s key focuses as put forward by CEO Lei Jun this year, they including growing its international footprint — Xiaomi now sells, or has sales partners, in over 20 countries — and building out an offline presence.
The company has opened 149 Mi Home stores in China, while it has opened its first in India, where it hopes to reach 100 stores over the next two years. The stores are aimed to fuse the online and offline commerce worlds to enable customers to get the best of both, for example in-store picks or ordering after trying.
On the international front, Xiaomi didn’t specify which new markets it is targeting, but did it reference a recent patent deal with Nokia that creates “a strong platform” for global expansions.
Xiaomi’s business has experienced a resurgence this year following two difficult years in which its previously impressive sales growth slowed. This year, it declined to give full numbers for 2016, marking its first non-reveal in its history, following an apparently disappointing year as competitors like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo released competitive devices and developed wide offline sales networks. Issues began appearing when Xiaomi missed its sales target for 2015, selling “over 70 million” devices but not the 80 million that Lei had previously forecast.
The past quarter, however, Xiaomi shipped an impressive 23.16 million smartphones, up 70 percent on the previous quarter.

Jon Russell,Apps,"PayPal has continued its strategy of expanding its presence on mobile after it revealed a tie-up with Baidu. The arrangement will allow the Chinese firm’s 100 million mobile wallet users to make payments to PayPal’s 17 million merchants through the Baidu service.
The news is the latest in a series of recent partnerships from PayPal, which this month expanded its integration with Apple and become a payment option with Samsung Pay. PayPal also inked extended agreements with Citi and Chase, added instant bank transfers, and made it easier for its merchants to sell worldwide.
“Important strategic partnerships are broadening the relevance of PayPal’s platform and increasing PayPal’s addressable market,” the firm said in a filing for its latest financial results.
For Baidu, the move represents a quick fire way to increase the competition with China’s leading mobile wallet companies, Alibaba’s Alipay (500 million users) and Tencent’s WeChat Pay (600 million users).
Those two services account for more than 90 percent of China’s mobile wallet market. They are estimated to have processed close to $3 trillion cumulatively in 2016, according to a UN report, which put Alipay slightly ahead of $1.7 trillion compared to $1.2 trillion for WeChat Pay. Baidu Wallet was not included in the study.
Both Alibaba and Tencent recently teamed up with Stripe to expand the use of their payment mechanisms outside of China, and this PayPal deal looks to be Baidu’s retort.

"Jon Russell,Katie Roof",Asia,"The long running saga over the future of Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal may be close to a conclusion at last. The company has been repeatedly linked with an acquisition by rival Flipkart, and now a deal worth a touch under $1 billion has been agreed to in principle.
That’s according to a report from Reuters which claims the Snapdeal board has signed off on a takeover from Flipkart that will be priced between $900 million-$950 million. TechCrunch has confirmed this independently via a source with knowledge of discussions. Seven-year-old Snapdeal, which had raised over $1.5 billion from investors that include SoftBank and Alibaba, was valued at $6.5 billion as recently as 2015.
In addition to that sell off, other assets are being offloaded. Economic Times reported that FreeCharge, the payment business that Snapdeal acquired two years ago, will be sold to Axis Bank.
Flipkart’s potential acquisition of Snapdeal would mark the resurgence of the company under new CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who took up the position in January of this year. Under his control, Flipkart — which lost ground on rivals over in recent years — has emerged as the primary rival to Amazon in India.
To push on, Flipkart raised $1.4 billion in fresh funding from eBay, Microsoft and Tencent in April at a valuation of $11.6 billion. While it was once valued as high as $15 billion, merely being in the position to bring in money from global investors was a major achievement, and that’s highlighted by Snapdeal’s own failure to do so.
Amazon itself has invested more than $5 billion into India’s business since it launched in the country in early 2012.

Jon Russell,Asia,"LG’s mobile business is in a sticky patch after the company admitted its flagship LG G6 smartphone hasn’t sold as well as expected.
LG Electronics itself posted a business-wide operating income of KRW 664.1 billion (USD 588.2 million) on overall revenue KRW 14.55 trillion (USD 12.89 billion). While LG’s operating income rose by 14 percent year-on-year to outpace a four percent annual growth in revenue, its overall numbers were curtailed by a mobile business that posted a KRW 132.4 billion ($117.27 million) loss for the quarter.
The “challenging” quarter was down to “weaker than expected premium smartphone sales and increase in component costs,” LG said. In the previous quarter, Q1 2017, LG’s smartphone shipments jumped over 10 percent to 14.8 million with the G6, which ditched the experimental modular approach of its predecessor, among its top performers. The company didn’t disclose sales for Q2.
The company’s phone business actually performed better this quarter than the same period in 2016, when it recorded a wider loss of KRW 153.5 billion (USD 132.10 million), even though its revenue fell by 19 percent year-on-year. But against the backdrop of three of the Korean company’s primary business units reporting increased revenue levels, its phone business is again the laggard.

Jon Russell,Asia,"WeWork is making a big move to win the co-working market in China after it announced the creation of a standalone WeWork China business, backed by $500 million from existing backers SoftBank, Hony Capital and other undisclosed investors.
This fresh influx of capital is not tied to a recent $760 million financing round that closed earlier this month, at a reported valuation of $20 billion. A source close to WeWork suggested to TechCrunch several weeks ago that another financing was around the corner, and a company spokesperson confirmed today the rounds are not linked.
The dedicated China business model is something that other major U.S. firms have adopted in China, including LinkedIn, Airbnb and Uber. None has truly proven the approach so far. Uber exited China when it sold its local business to rival Didi, LinkedIn’s head of China is leaving despite some successes, while the jury is still out on Airbnb, which made its local push as recently as March.
Currently WeWork operates eight locations across Greater China, with spaces in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. It said that this money, which is only for use via its China business, would be used to expand its presence in those three cities and move into more parts of China “on an accelerated timeframe.” The company estimates that it will have 15,000 members in China by the end of this year.
“We are extremely pleased to deepen our partnerships with Hony Capital and SoftBank to bring WeWork to more locations and cities across China at an even faster pace. Since coming to China only a year ago, we’ve been able to establish a vibrant community of creators and companies — and we’ve only just begun,” WeWork CEO Adam Neumann said in a statement.
The company has picked two close allies to help it build its business in China, in the face of emerging local competitors that include Naked Hub, a company that started out in resorts but is raising $200 million to expand across Asia, and URWork.
Beijing-based private equity firm Hony Capital first invested in WeWork last year. Its other deals in China have include bike-sharing firm Ofo, while it has also done investments in the U.S. and Israel. SoftBank, meanwhile, has been linked with WeWork for some time. It January, it emerged that the Japanese firm was in talks to invest as much as $4 billion into WeWork, having previously missed the chance to participate in two past funding rounds, according to a source.
WeWork said it operates 155 physical locations in 50 cities across 15 countries worldwide. Elsewhere in Asia, it has revealed plans to move into Japan — where it is working with SoftBank — and India, while it has been linked with a move into Southeast Asia via a Singapore-based space. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt New York in May, WeWork CEO Adam Neumann said his company is on progress to hit $1 billion in revenue this year.

Jon Russell,Asia,"It’s official — Amazon has launched its Prime Now delivery service in Singapore, its first market in Southeast Asia.
The Amazon apps went live in Singapore early last night local time, and Prime Now — an aggressive two-hour delivery service — is available to Singapore’s population of more than five million people from today. The launch includes “tens of thousands of items” but it isn’t the full Prime offering, which Amazon said will be available “soon” in Singapore.
TechCrunch reported that a launch would happen this week after Amazon’s initial target of Q1 2017, which we first reported back in November, was pushed back following complications.
The move brings Amazon into direct competition with Alibaba, which owns Southeast Asia-based e-commerce company Lazada. Lazada itself offers a Prime-like subscription service in partnership with Uber and Netflix, as well as grocery deliveries via Redmart, a service it acquired last year. Unlike Amazon, though, Redmart takes a minimum of one-day to fulfill orders. On top of that competitive advantage, Amazon is offering deep discounts for early users, although some customers complained that the coupon codes they used did not work.
“This is the first time we’re offering Prime Now to an entire country. Singapore allows us to launch to the whole country at the same time, but when you look at the Singapore consumer, at Singapore — it being urban, a great metropolitan city, people are very tech-savvy, it makes a great match with the Prime Now value proposition,” Henry Low, who is Amazon’s Director of Prime Now in Asia Pacific, told CNET in an interview.
The battle is just beginning, and there’s plenty to fight for.
With a cumulative population of more than 600 million, an emerging middle class and growing smartphone sales, Southeast Asia is seen as a market with potential for online services. The internet accounts for less than five percent of all retail today, but growth forecasts are bright. E-commerce in the region is tipped to grow from $5.5 billion in 2015 to $87.8 billion by 2025, according to a 2016 report from Google and Singapore’s sovereign fund Temasek.

That’s according a new report from analyst firm Canalys, which estimates that Xiaomi, which was valued at $45 billion at the end of 2014, shipped 15 million phones during the quarter to rank fourth in China. That’s a 60 percent rise from Q1 2017.
Despite that, Huawei maintained its lead from the previous quarter with 23 million shipments ahead of brother-sister companies Oppo (21 million) and Vivo (16 million), the two companies that rose to prominence last year in China and beyond. Apple completed the top five, according to Canalys, having been leapfrogged by Xiaomi.
As for the rest, sales were down for Apple, which just announced its first head of China, Samsung and Meizu. According to the report, the top five ranked companies pull in almost three-quarters of all shipments.
“Xiaomi still offers the best value in the Chinese market, and it remains the preferred choice for price-conscious consumers. The online channel continues to be a key route to market for Xiaomi and this quarter saw it take the lead in the 618 online sales events across online retail platforms, such as JD.com and Tmall,” Canalys analyst Lucio Chen said in a note.
CEO Lei Jun hailed Xiaomi’s resurgence this year, calling this most recent quarter “a major inflection point in our growth.”
“After two years of internal recalibration, Xiaomi is once again embarking on a rapid growth trajectory,” he told press, adding that the company is aiming to reach 100 million phone sales in 2018.
Xiaomi has always had a penchant for revealing its annual sales figures, thanks to some spectacular growth in its early days, but this year it declined to give full numbers for 2016, marking its first non-reveal in its history. Issues began appearing when Xiaomi missed its sales target for 2015, selling “over 70 million” devices but not the 80 million that Lei had previously forecast.
The rise of competitors like Oppo and Vivo, and Huawei’s focus on mid-range devices with its Honor brand, were largely seen as responsible for Xiaomi’s struggles. Equally, competitors became wise to Xiaomi’s online distribution tactics and mimicked them with some success. While, overseas, Xiaomi’s expansion plans failed to ignite, with India arguable the lone exception. That wasn’t helped by the departure of its head of international, Hugo Barra, who left to join Facebook earlier this year.
But 2017 could indeed be a different year. Canalys’ Chen forecasts that Xiaomi’s budget ‘Redmi’ brand, plus its new focus on expanding its offline retail footprint, will put pressure on Vivo, Oppo and Huawei to retain their positions and sales.",2017-07-26,1519166,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/p1040332.jpg?w=738,asia/,"smartphones,lei-jun,technology",Report: Xiaomi sales climb but Huawei remains China’s top smartphone brand,xiaomi,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/report-xiaomi-sales-climb-but-huawei-remains-chinas-top-smartphone-brand/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Hot on the heels of reports that Facebook is developing its own take on Amazon Echo, China’s Xiaomi has joined the tech company masses by jumping into the increasingly crowded smart speaker space.
The Mi AI Speaker is Xiaomi’s first take at rivaling the Echo, which has already inspired a product from Alibaba in China and counts offerings from Google and Apple among its competitors.
Building on the voice-controlled speaker that Xiaomi shipped in December, the new device is powered by artificial intelligence, the company said, which has just been added the Xiaomi’s MIUI operating system, a variant of Android. The speaker can be used as a control for Xiaomi products and also over 30 smart products from Xiaomi’s partners. Xiaomi touted its content available for the speaker, which includes music, audio books, kids stories and radio.
In terms of audio itself, the device uses a setup of six microphones for 360 degree sound broadcast.
The price will be 299 RMB, $45, when it goes on sale in August but the usual caveat applies. As is often the case with Xiaomi products, the initial release is confirmed for China but we don’t have word of international availability.
Early bird users in China can pick up a Mi AI Speaker for almost free — just 1RMB — in a working-beta test that Xiaomi says will improve the AI systems and “help train [it] to be even more intelligent in the early stage.”
The speaker was unveiled at an event in Beijing today where Xiaomi took the wraps of MIUI 9, which includes a bevy of AI-powered features such as a digital assistant and quick app launch capabilities.
The company also launched the Mi5X smartphone, a 5.5-inch device that ships with MIUI9 and features a dual rear camera. The phone is priced from 1499 RMB, or $220.",2017-07-26,1519154,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/xiaomi-mi-speaker.jpg?w=738,asia/,"amazon-com,home-automation,computing,software",Xiaomi’s take on the Amazon Echo smart speaker costs less than $50,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/xiaomi-mi-ai-speaker/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Tencent, Asia’s highest-valued tech company, has continued to invest in India after it backed online education service BYJU’s. The startup that includes the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Sequoia among its investors.
The size of the investment has not been disclosed, but a source close to the deal told TechCrunch that it values BYJU’s around the $800 million mark. Tencent has been less prolific in India than rival Alibaba, but its investments in the country include e-commerce giant Flipkart, healthcare firm Practo and chat app Hike.
Bangalore-based BYJU’s operates a range of online classes in India from students from grades 4-12 — it is named after founder and former teacher Byju Raveendran who started it in 2011. The company claims that it has nine million students using its apps, with 450,000 paying subscribers for the service overall. It said it has turned profitable in the last quarter with annual revenue more than doubling to reach $40 million for the  2016-2017 period.
Its business has attracted the interest of many esteemed investors, including Sequoia, which led a $75 million investment last March. That was quickly followed by a $50 million round led by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — the philanthropic fund from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan — in September 2016. The World Bank’s IFC fund added $15 million more in December. All in all, BYJU’s has raised more than $200 million from investors
“BYJU’S has emerged as the clear leader in the Indian education-tech sector. We share BYJU’S mission of transforming education by creating personalized learning experiences for students,” Hongwei Chen, executive director of investment and M&A at Tencent, said of the deal.

BYJU’s has focused on growth this year with two acquisitions of fellow India-based startups. The company sucked up career guidance service Vidyartha in January, and then TutorVista from U.S. media giant Pearson earlier this month.
The latter transaction is notable for a few reasons. BYJU’s positioned the deal as a potential accelerator to enable expansion into new markets — a vision the firm is seemingly moving towards — because of TutorVista’s range of services, which include digital content and information for school, test preparation and offline coaching to students, and management of K-12 schools. BYJU’s also got its hands on Edurite, a business selling educational CDs and DVDs which TutorVista acquired in 2007.
Pearson paid around $150 million over several investments to acquire TutorVista. Its acquisition by BYJU’s was never disclosed, but Indian tech media outlet The Ken claims it paid just $3 million for the deal. That would make it, potentially, a very good piece of business.
Expect more deals to come soon. BYJU’s said this new money from Tencent will go towards product development and “inorganic growth through acquisitions.”",2017-07-25,1518464,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-623625650.jpg?w=738,asia/,"rss,software,world-wide-web,computing",Tencent backs Indian education startup BYJU’s at a valuation of $800 million,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/tencent-backs-india-based-education-service-byjus/
Catherine Shu,Asia,"LG Display announced today that it will invest 7.8 trillion won (about $7 billion) to boost its OLED production capacity. This increases the stakes in LG’s competition with Samsung over OLED displays, a market that Samsung dominates by far, as Apple prepares to launch the iPhone 8, which is widely expected to come with OLED screens.
The new funding, which LG Display disclosed as part of its second-quarter earnings call today, brings LG Display’s total ongoing investment into OLED to 15 trillion won (about $13.5 billion). Part of the capital will go toward production of 10.5 generation large-size OLED displays in order to help LG compete with Chinese manufacturers and flexible OLED for both auto displays and smartphones. LG said it plans to invest in two new OLED production lines in Korea and one in Guangzhou, China.
LG’s announcement comes a few weeks after a report that Samsung, which already dominates the OLED market, plans to build the world’s largest OLED production plant in a bid to win orders from Apple. Apple, however, is also rumored to be developing its own OLED technology in a bid to reduce its dependence on Samsung.
According to LG, the market for OLED smartphone displays is expected to increase from 120 million units in 2017 to 370 million in 2020.",2017-07-25,1518572,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-647000916.jpg?w=738,asia/,"oled,lg-display",LG Display will add $7B to its OLED investment in an attempt to challenge Samsung,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/lg-display-will-add-7b-to-its-oled-investment-in-an-attempt-to-challenge-samsung/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Amazon is continuing its international expansion push with the launch of its services in Singapore coming imminently. The arrival could happen as soon as this week, according to a source with knowledge of the plans, and it will mark Amazon’s entry into Southeast Asia.
The launch will see Amazon Prime, Amazon Prime Now fast delivery and Amazon’s regular e-commerce services become available to Singapore’s population of over five million people, the source said. Pricing is unclear at this point.
Amazon had not replied to our request for comment at the time of writing.
TechCrunch first reported that Amazon was working on entering Southeast Asia last November, but the original window of Q1 2017 was pushed back following complications.
In a further hint, Amazon has already begun marketing its services through online influencers. A number of high-profile Instagram users in Singapore have posted sponsored teasers of Amazon’s Prime Now service in recent days. While not labeled Amazon, the distinctive tick on the packaging is a giveaway.
The e-commerce giant has spent 2017 pushing into new geographies and verticals. It expanded into the Middle East — via the acquisition of Souq.com — initiated a move into Australia, and it is in the process of buying Whole Foods in the U.S. for just shy of $14 billion. Now it is jumping into Southeast Asia, a region of 600 million consumers where rival Alibaba and fellow Chinese firm Tencent are already actively investing.
Alibaba entered the region last year when it bought a majority stake in Lazada, the e-commerce service originally founded by Rocket Internet. Alibaba has since increased its stake to 83 percent via another investment. Alibaba-Lazada preempted Amazon’s arrival with the acquisition of Singapore-based e-grocery company Redmart, and the introduction of a Prime-like membership service in partnership with Uber and Netflix. Amazon will also be keeping tabs on Indonesia’s Tokopedia, which a source told TechCrunch is in discussions with Tencent ally JD.com and Alibaba over an investment that could reach $500 million.
At stake is a market that, alongside India, is seen as fertile ground for internet companies seeking growth.
Online is estimated to account for less than five percent of all commerce today in Southeast Asia, but the region is tipped to grow significantly over the next decade, according to a report from Google and Singapore-based fund Temasek published last year. E-commerce in the region is tipped to grow from $5.5 billion in 2015 to $87.8 billion by 2025, according to the report. That’s fueled by an emerging middle class and increased internet access — currently 3.8 million new users are coming online per month.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth highest-populated country, is tipped to account for over 50 percent of that e-commerce spending by 2025. Amazon has picked Singapore for its initial entry point to Southeast Asia, primary because of Westernized consumer consumption and its position as a regional hub, but we understand that Indonesia is on its radar for the future.",2017-07-25,1518521,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-696675012.jpg?w=738,asia/,"aviation,tencent",Amazon prepares to enter Southeast Asia via Singapore launch,"alibaba,amazon",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/amazon-singapore-launch/
Catherine Shu,Asia,"Urbanbase, a Seoul-based startup that makes virtual reality tools for interior planning and design, plans to expand in Asia after raising $1.8 million in Series A funding. Its investors are CKD Venture Capital, Magellan Technology and Capstone Partners.
The company, which was founded in 2013 by CEO Jinu Ha, a former architect, has now raised about $3 million in total. Urbanbase’s patented algorithm turns 2D floor plans into virtual spaces in as little as two minutes, it claims, and is more accessible for small companies than cameras like Matterport. Urbanbase’s virtual reality platform lets users see how their future homes will look and test furniture, wallpaper and flooring.
Co-founder and chief strategy officer Saejoon Oh says the company currently has 40 partnerships with furniture companies, with about 4,000 items available in its VR platform. It also works with real estate companies to provide floor plans for apartment buildings in Korea.
About 60 percent of total households in Korea, or about 8.5 million, currently live in apartments, Oh adds. Urbanbase’s platform helps small businesses reach them and compete with big-box retailers like Ikea, which entered Korea in 2014. In addition to its virtual reality tools, Urbanbase also plans to launch augmented reality smartphone apps.
While Oh says Urbanbase currently doesn’t have much competition within Korea, it is preparing for the likelihood that big furniture retailers, as well as tech companies that are already sitting on a lot of indoor mapping data, will eventually want to enter the space. In the meantime, its Series A will be used to enter Japan, China and countries in Southeast Asia.",2017-07-25,1518429,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/urbanbase-group-picture2.png?w=640,asia/,"interior-design,real-estate,virtual-reality,urbanbase",Korean startup Urbanbase gets $1.8M to turn apartment floor plans into virtual reality,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/korean-startup-urbanbase-gets-1-8m-to-turn-apartment-floor-plans-into-virtual-reality/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Grab, the ride-hailing company competing with Uber in Southeast Asia, has pulled in $2 billion of new financing from existing investors Didi Chuxing, the company that defeated Uber in China, and SoftBank.
Didi said the round could expand by $500 million more with input from other existing backers and new investors, too. A Grab representative confirmed that SoftBank’s Vision fund is not part of the current commitment, it is coming from SoftBank Group Corp.
A source confirmed that this new money gives Grab a post-money valuation of more than $6 billion. That’s more than double the $3 billion valuation that Grab commanded from its most recent round of funding in September 2016, when it raised $750 million.
“We are delighted to deepen our strategic partnership with DiDi and SoftBank. We’re encouraged that these two visionary companies share our optimism for the future of Southeast Asia and its on-demand transportation and payments markets, and recognize that Grab is ideally positioned to capitalize on the massive market opportunities,” said Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab.
Essentially, both Didi and SoftBank are doubling down on the belief that Grab has what it takes to defeat Uber in Southeast Asia, the same way that Didi did in China when Uber agreed to sell its local business last August. That hope of defeating the U.S. firm was reignited this month when Uber agreed to sell its business in Russia to local rival Yandex.
“Starting with transport, Grab is establishing a clear leadership in Southeast Asia’s internet economy based on its market position, superior technology, and truly local insight,” Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, added via a statement that is fairly damning of Uber. (Didi is an investor in Uber by virtue of the China acquisition deal.)
Grab operates in 36 cities across seven countries in Southeast Asia, where it claims over 50 million downloads from users and 1.1 million drivers on its platform. Its services are primarily focused on licensed taxis and private cars, but Grab also offers motorbike taxis, shuttle bus services and carpooling in a selection of countries.
Uber doesn’t reveal public data for its Southeast Asia-based business. But one rival that is upsetting Grab is Go-Jek, a bike and car on-demand platform in Indonesia that is seen widely as the market leader in the country.
On a business-level, Uber began to see profitability in selected markets in Southeast Asia last summer, sources told us at the time, but it increased its investment in the market (and India) following its exit from China, which then-CEO Travis Kalanick revealed was costing the firm $1 billion a year. A Grab spokesperson said the company is profitable “in certain verticals and cities, but we don’t break that down.” Grab did share the results of a study it commissioned which found it owns 95 percent marketshare of licensed taxi e-hailing and 71 percent of private cars across Southeast Asia.
In a bid to take its business to the next level, Grab is also developing a mobile payments platform. That began as a mechanism to accept payment via credit cards, having started out as cash-only, but that focus has also seen Grab develop a fintech push in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth most populous country.
Indonesia is tipped to account for more than half of the revenue of ride-sharing services across the region by 2025, with the overall industry forecast to $13.1 billion that year up from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report co-authored by Google last year. Grab sees a lot of that potential stuck behind the country’s outdated banking system, and it is working on financial inclusion systems to help grow the consumer pie that it serves.
At the start of 2017, Grab announced a $700 million investment program to build its services in Indonesia, of which at least $100 million is dedicated to investments and acquisitions. It didn’t take long to dip into that, with Grab buying offline payment startup Kudo two months later in a deal sources told TechCrunch could be worth as much as $100 million over time.
The fintech play is a move to battle Go-Jek, which began offering payment services before Grab dipped its toes into the market. Sources close to Go-Jek told TechCrunch that the company raised $1.2 billion led by Tencent in May, although it did not confirm that at the time and hasn’t announced the raise. This new capital raise from Grab immediately puts pressure on Go-Jek’s own financial position.",2017-07-23,1517833,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/grabcar.jpg?w=738,asia/,"car-sharing,economy,business,transport",Grab gets $2B from Didi and SoftBank to fuel bid to defeat Uber in Southeast Asia,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/23/grab-raises-2b-from-didi-chuxing-and-softbank/
Jon Russell,Asia,"The U.S. tech IPO window may have reopened in 2017 following a lull last year, but the outlook is also looking rosier for another listing platform located on the other side of world.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) is experiencing a renaissance of sorts among the tech industry. Selfie app company Meitu held the largest listing from a tech company for nearly a decade in December — raising more than $500 million with its floating — while in recent weeks PC gaming brand Razer and Tencent-controlled e-books service China Publishing have both announced their intention to list in the city-state.
Hong Kong was widely thought to have blown its chance to put itself on the global map when Alibaba opted for a New York listing in 2014 because the HKSE was unable to accommodate its company structure. But, nearly three years on, the tide appears to be turning for some.
Speaking on stage at our TechCrunch China event in Shenzhen last month, a senior executive for logistics on-demand company Lalamove said his firm is eying a public listing in Hong Kong before 2020. Blake Larson, head of international for the company — which raised a $30 million Series B in January — said a dual-listing in the U.S. is possible, but the HKSE is the priority to “show it is possible to build a global technology company from Hong Kong.”
There’s plenty of interest beyond local companies, too, it seems. At the Rise event in Hong Kong this month, TechCrunch spoke to two founders who anonymously revealed that their Asia-based companies, each of which has raised more than $100 million in investment and does business worldwide, are devoting significant time towards a potential HKSE IPO in the future.
Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliated fintech firm, has also been linked with a Hong Kong IPO. The firm raised over $3 billion at a valuation of up to $60 billion at the beginning of the year — that cash injection is reported to have pushed its much-anticipated IPO plan back to at least 2018 at the earliest.
Hong Kong may have landed a collection of reputable companies in Meitu, Razer and China Publishing, but it still has some way to go before it becomes a viable option for all.
For one thing, this trio all have notable businesses and brands in China, which is really a requisite factor. But there are further complications. Regulations make it difficult for companies that are still scaling their business to go public in Hong Kong since the exchange has stringent financial requirements.
“I definitely think the HKSE can be a destination for tech IPOs, but the Hong Kong government, administration and its investors all need to change their rules and ways to analyze growth potential of unprofitable internet companies,” Hans Tung, a partner with U.S.-China VC firm GGV, told TechCrunch.
Those thoughts were echoed by Kee Lock Chua, group president and CEO of Vertex Holdings, a firm affiliated with Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek.
“The Hong Kong Exchange is a viable listing venue for technology companies because of its liquidity and valuation,”Chua said in an email. “[But] the Hong Kong market generally still prefers profitable companies.”
“Technology companies that are growing rapidly but not profitable in the short term may find the U.S. market to be more suitable,” he added.
Another issue is that share structure factor. Hong Kong somewhat famously does not allow dual classes of common equity in its companies. That was the main facto that saw Alibaba head West for its IPO, which was a record U.S. listing and a major loss for Hong Kong.
“Alibaba should have been able to IPO in Hong Kong, the HKSE should have allowed Alibaba’s partnership structure to exist. Google and many tech companies have super voting structures on the Nasdaq. An Alibaba IPO in Hong Kong would have been a game changer,” Tung explained.
That said, there are young companies that have made it despite the requirements.
“Our portfolio company IGG [a mobile games developer] was listed on the GEM board [for growth companies] initially and was subsequently promoted to the Hong Kong main board. Today, it is trading at $2.5 billion in market cap,” Vertex’s Chua said.
The political uncertainty in the U.S. right now coupled with the development of unicorn startups across Asia gives Hong Kong a viable shot at becoming a credible IPO option. But the U.S. still retains cachet for tech companies in Asia and that’s reflect in those that are most likely to list next.
Tech firms like Singapore-based games firm Sea (formerly known as Garena), Vietnam’s gaming and messaging company VNG, and e-commerce company Reboonz (backed by both Vertex and GGV) are all reported to be exploring opportunities having grown beyond the venture capital ecosystem. However, in each case, media reports are linking them to U.S.-based IPOs.
Yet, there are no happy stories of Asian companies — excluding those from China — listing in America in recent times.
MOL Global is probably the most notable case. The Malaysian payment firm traded on the Nasdaq for a fairly turbulent 18-month period. Things got off to a bad start when the share price dipped 30 percent on its debut in October 2014, and, following a series of crises, the firm announced its delisting in April 2016. Ironically, MOL is involved in Razer’s IPO following an investment deal.
Sea is likely to be the first of the new Asian contenders to test the waters in the U.S. — Japanese chat app Line opted for a dual Tokyo-U.S. listing to mitigate risk last year — and how it performs, if and when it goes public, could be a deciding factor for others considering a similar route. In the meantime, it’ll be fascinating to see if the HKSE’s two incoming listings can convince more Asian founders to look away from the U.S. when it comes to going public.",2017-07-21,1517402,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/hong-kong-1.jpg?w=738,asia/,"tencent,razer,ipo,hong-kong",Hong Kong is showing promise as a destination for tech IPOs,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/21/hong-kong-ipo-destination/
