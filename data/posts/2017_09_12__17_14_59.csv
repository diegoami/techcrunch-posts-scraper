Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"GetAccept co-founder Mathias Thulin is very familiar with a common problem sales representatives have: they have a great meeting with a potential customer, fire off an email to follow up on that deal and send a thank you note, and then hear nothing back.
With all these leads going dark, Thulin and his co-founder Samir Smajic wanted to dig into the data to figure out what was happening. To do that, they decided to start GetAccept, an e-signature service that helps representatives track their documents and help close those deals. The start-up today said that it has raised $1.6 million in a seed funding round from Amino Capital and Y Combinator, as well as other angel investors. GetAccept came out of Y Combinator in 2016.
“Too many times you had a great meeting that you just said, ah I love this, send me a proposal and I will talk with my manager and get back to you next week,” Thulin said. “Then, they just go dark. There are much more decision-makers involved that they tell you about, and also that it’s so hard to understand how engaged they actually are. You don’t know what’s happening after you sent the proposal. It’s so easy to ignore your inbox and phone when you try to follow-up with a sales rep.”
Internally, GetAccept analyses a sales representative’s behavior to see why they are closing on more deals, or vice versa. It looks for cues, like a sales representative including a product demo or the company connecting directly through a chat bot that then connects them directly to another representative. These sales representatives can also lean on retargeting, chasing their leads across platforms in order to build that awareness. Thulin argues that it’s all these light touches that can help companies close that deal, but often times they just go overlooked.

He also likes to say that his startup is based on artificial intelligence — though you won’t find it at the deep, complex level of a convolutional neural network. But there is certainly some learning happening in the background, with algorithms studying the behavior of the best sales people and the trick and quirks they have that are helping them close better sales leads. It’s not some kind of hardcore AI that would come out of a lab at Stanford, but this kind of self-reflecting software is a hallmark of many emerging enterprise sales startups that look to help businesses streamline their processes.
“If we could find the triggers that could help push the deal forward, we would do it,” Smajic said. “We see that it’s really for different reasons why sales reps can push the lead forward. If [potential customers] don’t open the document in 24 hours, then we definitely need to address it. We also see another case that if they forward it to other people [in the organization] that the deal will be postponed because there are people involved. We figured out we couldn’t use generic tools, and that was the reason.”
GetAccept, with this seed funding, still faces an uphill battle against e-signature companies like DocuSign and lead tracking from existing lead-tracking CRM start-ups like Gong or Attach. Those are two very significant markets, though Smajic says that by targeting a product that does both of them will help them outmaneuver the companies that look to eventually dig into each others’ territories. Getting there first will help, though it remains to be seen if they will be able to get the kind of widespread adoption that these companies have already built up.",2017-09-04,1535201,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/founders_20171.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,,GetAccept raises $1.6M to help companies close sales leads faster,y-combinator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/getaccept-raises-1-6m-to-help-companies-close-sales-leads-faster/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Michael and Susan Dell have doubled down on the tech industry’s commitment to bail out Texas as it recovers from Hurricane Harvey. The couple pledged a whopping $36 million to the effort through their foundation today.
The money, which represents the largest single contribution to date for the disaster, comes in the form of an $18 million seed contribution, followed by a dollar matching pledge up to another $18 million for a total of $36 million.
“Susan and I are committing $36M to this important work, by giving half this amount to launch the fund, and by starting a matching campaign that will kick off today and continue through midnight on Monday, September 4. During the campaign, we will match $1 for every $2 you donate,” The Dells wrote in a blog post on their foundation website.
The goal is to raise $100 million via a combination of private contributions and dollar matching by the Dell Foundation for people ravaged by the storm surge.
For the Dells, who both grew up in Texas, this hits home. “This disaster is personal to everyone who has roots in Texas. Both of us were born and raised in Texas, and the street Michael grew up on in Houston is under water now,” they wrote in the blog post.
The Dells launched the Foundation 15 years ago to help children living in urban poverty on a global scale, concentrating on education and healthcare. Working with partner organizations, the Foundation has committed more than $1.38 billion to the effort, according to the Foundation website.

John Mannes,Cloud,"Facebook is planning to open source LogDevice, the company’s custom-built solution for storing logs collected from distributed data centers. The company made the announcement as part of its Scale conference.
Logs are used to track database events. If a server suffers an outage for any reason, companies need a way to debug, perform security audits and ensure consistency between servers. This is particularly important to Facebook, which holds immense amounts of your content across its massive data centers around the world.
LogDevice is capable of recording data regardless of hardware or network issues. If something breaks, it will simply hand-off the task of collecting logs. And when everything turns back on, LogDevice can restore records at between five and 10 gigabytes per second.
If you’re Facebook, and will soon have 10 data centers, you need a system of record to ensure each center is on the same page. And things get extra complicated when you consider the complexity of backups the company needs to do with its data. LogDevice helps when you need to replicate data from these separate data centers.
If you get frustrated and regretfully throw an expensive server across the room, LogDevice will report exactly which records were lost. By separating record sequencing and storage, and randomly assigning records to different storage locations, it enhances resiliency of the entire data center.
Facebook didn’t give an exact date for when it expects to open source LogDevice, but it says it will occur later in 2017.",2017-08-31,1534412,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/21267728_10110519477908865_1022841449_o1.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"data-management,software,computing",Facebook to open source LogDevice for storing logs from distributed data centers,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/facebook-to-open-source-logdevice-for-storing-logs-from-distributed-data-centers/
Ron Miller,Apps,"Salesforce and IBM are joining forces again as they attempt to deepen their alliance. The partnership began last March when they agreed to sell each other’s artificial intelligence products, Watson and Einstein. Today’s announcement is all about data integration.
Salesforce will be adding the ability to include IBM weather data in Lightning apps, while IBM will enable customers to easily build apps that include Salesforce data.
IBM bought The Weather Company in 2015 because it was hot for all that delicious data. Apparently Salesforce is too, because the first part of today’s announcement involves a few specific types of weather data integration on the Salesforce Lightning platform.
For starters, there is a Lightning component called Weather Focus, which allows developers to build weather data into applications. For example, a customer building an ecommerce app on Salesforce could automatically adjust the delivery date of a purchase based on weather conditions.
Secondly, Weather Recorder lets users record weather data by date range directly into a Salesforce record. This could come in handy, for example, for an insurance app to incorporate information about a catastrophic weather event and help underwriters understand the conditions at the time of the claim.
Finally, with the Scheduling Assistant you can set up appointments based on weather data, making sure there isn’t say a snow storm in the forecast that could keep you from showing up.
The second part of today’s announcement is about incorporating Salesforce data into IBM apps. Just as you can build weather data into Salesforce apps, you can also incorporate Salesforce data into IBM apps now via IBM Cloud Integration for Salesforce. This could be useful for pulling Salesforce data together with news and other relevant data to enable salespeople to react more quickly to customer needs based on a variety of external conditions (including the weather).
When you hear that IBM and Salesforce are partnering, you might do a double take — who and who? The two companies couldn’t be more different. IBM is over a century old and has experienced more than a few significant business shifts in its time. Salesforce is a youngster by comparison, born as cloud company in the late 1990s to take on establishment companies like IBM.
But the two organizations have the enterprise in common, and chances are they have customers who want to use data from one another. Ultimately, this is a simple data integration story, giving each company’s customers easy access to some valuable data.",2017-08-31,1534312,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-173639499.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"partnerships,ibm","Salesforce, IBM deepen partnership with new app integrations",salesforce,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/salesforce-and-ibm-deepen-partnership-with-some-new-app-integrations/
Katie Roof,Enterprise,"Cloud storage company Box reported second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday. And although the company beat expectations on revenue and losses, it wasn’t enough to please Wall Street.  The stock fell almost 4% in after-hours trading.
It seems that part of the issue related to the company losing its cash flow positive status for the quarter, coming in at a negative $14.7 million.  But Levie told TechCrunch that investors shouldn’t worry going forward because the company is “going to be free cash flow positive for the entire year.”
Box brought in $122.9 million in revenue, up 28% year-over-year. It’s also above the $121.7 million that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters.
Adjusted losses were 11 cents per share, when analysts were predicting a loss of 13 cents. This was 3 cents better than it was for the same period last year.
It was “one of our strongest quarters from momentum and innovation,” said Levie. Box has “thousands of new and existing customers.”
He also spoke highly of Stephanie Carillo, the new COO that Box just hired. She’s “really taking the reigns.”
The company said its revenue for the year is expected to be between $503 million and $506 million.
Levie said that artificial intelligence and machine learning are going to be key focuses for Box this year.

Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Dropbox continues to tune its products as it tries to tap a bigger audience within larger companies with some updates today to its collaboration tool Paper, including the ability to preview documents before loading them.
As a blank slate, Paper is increasingly popular with designers you might talk to in Silicon Valley. It basically turns the process of designing and building a product spec into a living, breathing flow of information online. As such, Dropbox seems to have started to recognize the opportunity of catering to these users as it starts the drip-drip-drip of incremental product updates to suit those popular needs.
Here’s a quick rundown of what’s getting updated today: users are able to create folders on their mobile devices and move Paper documents into them; they can now delete or archive their Paper documents on their phones; finally, users can now preview Paper documents before opening them. All of these seem to be on the smallish side, but they’re worth noting as Dropbox is a company that touts its simplicity and has to take care not to feature creep a product like Paper.
Dropbox is also giving developers a way to create or edit Paper documents in their own apps, which is a move that will potentially move the product outside of the bounds of the traditional Dropbox experience. But this is also important because it gives third parties which are accustomed to working on these kinds of documents in their own environments a way to do that with Dropbox.
That’s a perpetual danger for any company that tries to lean on its brand as a simpler product, especially as the company tries to break into a mainstream enterprise tool that has to cater to dozens of different team requirements. Dropbox’s challenge is building a more generalized, abstract version of the collaboration tools you might find in other massive products.
It’s going to need to do just that as the company seems increasingly primed for an IPO. The company is reportedly following all the incremental steps toward going public. It’s inevitably going to be compared to companies like Box or Microsoft, but with an origin story as a consumer product, it has to provide a unique pitch if it looks to become a full-fledged business that’s able to tap both consumer and enterprise demand.",2017-08-30,1533753,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dropbox-paper-beta.png?w=738,enterprise/,paper,Dropbox Paper gets document previews and some other small updates,"microsoft,box,dropbox-inc",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/dropbox-paper-gets-document-previews-and-some-other-small-updates/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"As blockchains begin to gain in popularity, a need is developing to enable them to communicate with one another. That would require a networking infrastructure to facilitate that communication, and that’s precisely what Nuco, a Toronto-based startup is trying to do with the release of the Aion blockchain network today.
Nuco CEO Matthew Spoke says that while each network is ultimately responsible for building its own level of trust within its blockchain, once you start to move outside the realm of your private blockchain as banks, governments, healthcare providers and anyone else working with this kind of data is inevitably going to do, you need a system to make that happen. Nuco built Aion to provide that mechanism.
He says that at its core, Aion becomes the plumbing to move data around. “[Aion provides the] middleware for blockchains to communicate with each other, and the ability to pass messages between them,” he says.
Spoke, who along with his co-founders, were originally part of the blockchain team at Deloitte, formed the company last year to begin building enterprise blockchain infrastructure, but they began to realize that while many large organizations were building private blockchains, there was a growing need for a public mechanism. As the blockchain concept begins to scale and becomes an integral part of the economic system, it requires a generic way of moving information.
There are a couple of major hurdles to get people to build and use a system like this. First of all, they have to convince organizations to move information between blockchains in a public way. Second, it requires a single way to move that information, a kind of networking protocol. Once they agree to the former, the latter becomes an inevitable requirement.
Companies can find a way to monetize their participation on the network by charging Aion tokens, a type of digital currency, to move certain kinds of data across inter-chain bridges. This ability could lure more companies to move to the network, Spoke explained.
That said, he sees Aion as a market necessity, not something they are looking to commercialize in a direct way. At some point blockchain will hit mainstream adoption and it will require mature infrastructure for his company and others to succeed. Spoke says his company is making this contribution to help the market grow.
While Nuco isn’t the only company working on this problem, Spoke is convinced that a process like this is required, and that like any technology, the market will decide which approach wins and becomes the standard.",2017-08-30,1533563,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-676434248.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"blockchains,network,nuco",Nuco’s Aion network provides a way to communicate between multiple blockchains,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/nucos-aion-network-provides-a-way-to-communicate-between-multiple-blockchains/
Ron Miller,Developer,"Plaid, which is best known for helping financial services customers build applications with direct connections to their users’ bank accounts, announced today that they have released a new SDK to bring that same type of functionality to enterprise developers.
“At a high level we are the middle layer between you and your bank,” Zach Perret, CEO at Plaid told TechCrunch. When a financial services application needs to link to your bank account in a secure fashion, there’s a good chance it could be using Plaid’s tools. The company can also track transactions, verify identity, check your balance and verify income.
The new Link SDK for enterprise announced today enables enterprise developers with no financial services background to build similar functionality into any application. Given that there are lots of scenarios where it would be useful to link an app to a bank account, having a simple and secure way to do that lets the developers concentrate on their own expertise.
APIs are making it easy for developers to layer a variety of different tools inside an application without having to have the expertise to build it from scratch. It’s a common approach. Stripe does it for payments. Okta does it for identity. Box does it for content services and Twilio does it for communications, as a few examples.
If you’ve ever been to a hackathon, you see how powerful this approach can be. With less than 24 hours to build an application, developers are able to create rich apps with a variety of functionality, but not all SDKs are created equal, and Perret says that Plaid is trying to gain an edge by simplifying the developer experience.
He says a big part of his company’s approach is building an attractive interface that makes it easier to add Plaid features to an app, and while they’ve tuned this version specifically for enterprise developers, they are still using the same developer-centric approach they have been using in the original product.
The company has been around since 2012 and has raised almost $60 million. Its most recent round was a $44 million Series B in June 2016. Investors include Goldman Sachs, NEA and Spark Capital.
Plaid works with 9600 banks  including Wells Fargo, Citi, and Chase. One of its earliest customers was Venmo, the app used to send cash from a bank account to any third-party (and which has been used to settle more than a few college bar bills).",2017-08-30,1533498,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-675247672.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"apis,software,financial-services,plaid",Plaid delivers bank account integration to enterprise developers,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/plaid-delivers-bank-account-integration-functionality-to-enterprise-developers/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"OpenStack, the massive open-source project that aims to bring the power and ease of use of public clouds like AWS and Azure to private data centers, today launched Pike, the sixteenth major version of its software. As usual, there’s a massive number of updates here, but the core theme is that the various development teams have focused on making OpenStack more composable, so that companies can more easily pick and choose the features they want. In addition, the community has renewed its focus on helping OpenStack operators manage the lifecycle of the various OpenStack tools with services like Kubernetes and Ansible.
Mark Collier, the OpenStack Foundation’s COO, and Lauren Sell, the organization’s VP of Marketing and Community Services, told me earlier this week that they are now seeing a number of emerging use cases for OpenStack. One of these is edge computing — a trend that Microsoft, Amazon and other public cloud providers are also now addressing. “There is a huge demand for cloud computing in many different forms,” Collier said. “That’s impacting what we’re doing.” Some of the most prominent companies that are now looking at using OpenStack for their edge computing solution include Verizon (TechCrunch’s corporate overlords), Walmart (which wants to do computing right in its stores) and Inmarsat (which is looking at using OpenStack to power the on-board computing power on large ships).

Collier and Sell also noted that in their view, multi-cloud is becoming a standard operating model now and that many of the businesses the organization is talking to aren’t just looking at using multiple public clouds for their workloads but are also operating private clouds. “One piece of this, too, is that it’s also not that binary — it’s not private or public,” Sell said. “It’s becoming much more of a spectrum.”
Why the trend toward private clouds? Collier and Sell argue that it’s about cost, capabilities and compliance. Indeed, I’ve now heard from a number of enterprises that are moving to private clouds because their steady workloads aren’t a good fit for the public cloud billing model, which gives you a lot of flexibility to turn servers on and off, but you pay a premium for that. For workloads that run close to 24/7, operating a private cloud can often be more affordable.
For many companies, a private cloud also gives them access to capabilities that aren’t available in the public cloud. That may be specific networking functions for the many telecoms that operate OpenStack deployments, or specific hardware for machine learning workloads. For others, operating a private cloud isn’t even optional, especially if they have to fulfill certain regulatory and data sovereignty requirements.
Collier also noted there’s a trend toward having third-party vendors like RackSpace, Canonical or Mirantis operate these private clouds, which in his view means that the companies are getting the best of both worlds: the cost-savings and capabilities of a private cloud combined with the ease of use of public clouds.
OpenStack also is seeing massive growth in interest in China. Some of the largest enterprises there run OpenStack clouds, including the country’s largest railway system, China UnionPay, China Mobile, Huawei and ZTE. It’s also worth noting that Tencent’s massively popular WeChat service runs at least partially on OpenStack. This momentum is creating a new local startup ecosystem of companies that want to support these users.
Looking ahead, Collier and Sell noted that the organization is now looking at how the project can better support new use cases like edge computing and machine learning.",2017-08-29,1533149,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_20161025_090744.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"edge-computing,enterprise,open-source,openstack",OpenStack sees new use cases in edge computing and fast-growing interest in China,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/openstack-sees-new-use-cases-in-edge-computing-and-fast-growing-interest-in-china/

John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"SQL is about as easy as it gets in the world of programming, and yet its learning curve is still steep enough to prevent many people from interacting with relational databases. Salesforce’s AI research team took it upon itself to explore how machine learning might be able to open doors for those without knowledge of SQL.
Their recent paper, Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language using Reinforcement Learning, builds on sequence to sequence models typically employed in machine translation. A reinforcement learning twist allowed the team to obtain promising results translating natural language database queries into SQL.
In practice this means that you could simply ask who the winningest team in college football is and an appropriate database could be automatically queried to tell you that it is in fact the University of Michigan.
“We don’t actually have just one way of writing a query the correct way,” Victor Zhong, one of the Salesforce researchers who worked on the project, explained to me in an interview. “If I give a natural language question, there might be two or three ways to write the query. We use reinforcement learning to encourage use of queries that obtain same result.”

You can imagine how machine translation problems can quickly become massively complex with large vocabularies. The more you can limit the number of possible translations for each missing word, the simpler your problem becomes. To this avail, Salesforce opted to limit its vocabulary to words used in database labels, the words in the question being asked and the words typically used in SQL queries.
The idea of democratizing SQL isn’t new. Startups like ClearGraph, which was recently acquired by Tableau, have made it their business to open up data with English rather than SQL.
“Some models perform execution on a database itself,” added Zhong. “But there’s potential privacy concerns if you’re asking a question about Social Security numbers.”
Outside of the paper itself, Salesforce’s biggest contribution here comes in the form of the WikiSQL data set it constructed to aid in building its model. First HTML tables were collected from Wikipedia. These tables became the basis for randomly generated SQL queries. These queries were used to form questions that were then passed off to humans for paraphrasing over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each paraphrasing was verified twice with additional human guidance. The resulting data set is the largest such data set in existence.",2017-08-29,1532977,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-699934842.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"computing,data-management,cleargraph",Salesforce is using AI to democratize SQL so anyone can query databases in natural language,salesforce,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/salesforce-is-using-ai-to-democratize-sql-so-anyone-can-query-databases-in-natural-language/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"There was a time when two-factor identification (2FA) was nice to have, but times have changed as hackers get ever more sophisticated and users need whatever edge they can get. Perhaps that’s why Okta, the cloud identity company that went public earlier this year, announced that it’s making 2FA the standard for all its customers.
They made the announcement at their annual Oktane customer conference today.
Research suggests that a large number of breaches are related to stolen or weak passwords. There is actually a black market on the so-called Dark Web where hackers can buy stolen credentials. This point is exacerbated by the fact that too many people tend to use the same password across sites, so if you get caught up in one high-profile hack — and given the sheer number of them, it’s entirely likely — chances are, that password is out there waiting to be used on your company’s network.
Okta recognizes that, so it’s implementing 2FA as a standard, presenting every user with a one-time passcode to add another layer of protection that will be harder for hackers to surface. What’s more, the company also sees the password reuse problem so it’s adding a compromised password detection tool, which can find commonly-used passwords from large, publicly-known data breaches and warn users if they are using them.
It’s certainly a big step forward, and while 2FA isn’t a panacea, Joe Diamond, who runs security for Okta says it’s still better than just a username and password because it’s adding that additional layer of protection.
The company is also announcing a new set of APIs to make it easier to build Okta identity management into apps. The APIs provide a way to extend the market for the service without explicitly signing up to use it.
In this case Okta becomes the identity layer in an app in the same way that Twilio lets you add communications capabilities or Stripe enables you to add payments. This takes the complexity of implementing identity management, something every app should have, out of the hands of a developer, who probably lacks the expertise to build in identity well.
Developers win because they greatly simplify identity management, while Okta gains a new revenue stream. Pricing is based on how many active monthly users you have.
Okta went public in April. The stock price closed at $23.51 on the first day of trading. Today, as of publication, it sits at $24.30, which is rather steady and undramatic.

Ron Miller,Cloud,"When VMware, Pivotal and Google announced a containerization partnership this morning at VMworld, it sounded more like the introduction to a joke — Google, VMware and Pivotal walked into a bar… But in fact, it’s probably not a coincidence that these three companies have joined together.
They actually have a long and intertwined history — with former VMware co-founder and CEO Diane Greene, who is now in charge of Google Cloud, acting as the glue between these organizations. That tells you how interconnected this industry is. It’s so intertwined, in fact, that we can trace this deal to seven moves that began back in 1998 when VMware was formed.
Here we go:
1 Diane Greene helped launch VMware in 1998
In the beginning Diane Greene helped launch VMware and it was good. The company went onto to transform IT by becoming the standard for virtual machines in the data center. EMC bought VMware in 2003.
2 VMware launches Cloud Foundry in 2011
Three years after Greene departed from the company in 2008, VMware created Cloud Foundry, the open source Platform as a Service.
3 EMC and VMware create Pivotal to commercialize Cloud Foundry in 2013
In 2012, EMC bought Pivotal Labs, a company focused on helping customers develop the agile methodology. In 2013, EMC and VMware launched Pivotal (along with GE as a limited partner) and handed off the commercial Cloud Foundry business to Pivotal.
4 Google developed Kubernetes in 2014
A year later in 2014, Google released the first version of Kubernetes, which went onto to become a popular open source container orchestration engine.
5 Diane Greene joined Google Cloud in 2015
In December 2015, Google bought a startup called Bebop and with it brought one of the company’s founders, none other than Diane Greene, to run Google Cloud.
6 Diane Greene hired Sam Ramji from the Cloud Foundry Foundation in 2016
A year later Greene brought in Sam Ramji, who was CEO at Cloud Foundry, who then became VP of product management under Greene.
7 VMware partnered with Pivotal and Google in 2017
Just today, the three companies came together to form a partnership around containers, but the groundwork of a partnership had its genesis in the web of relationships that formed long before that.
And if you want to see another layer, consider that Dell bought EMC last year for $67 billion, and with it brought VMware and Pivotal into the fold.
__
So why does this all matter beyond highlighting incestuousness in Silicon Valley? Regardless of the fact that these people and companies are familiar with one another, there still needs to be a business benefit for customers and the companies involved, or they aren’t going to come together no matter how friendly they happen to be.
The fact is that Google is looking to gain deeper entre into the enterprise. VMware is key to this. VMware is looking for a way into the cloud and this gives them cachet with Google, while Pivotal is looking for more companies to use Cloud Foundry. If companies like Google and VMware are pushing it, it creates momentum that would be harder to get on its own.

Ron Miller,Apps,"There is a general misconception that Apple is strictly about consumer tools, but the fact is that the company has a big presence in the enterprise just by the sheer number of iPhones and iPads in the business world. It also has some high-profile partnerships with hefty enterprise vendors like IBM, SAP and Cisco. Today, Apple announced that it is building on those relationships with a brand new partnership with Accenture, the global consulting firm.
The companies plan to work together to help customers build advanced digital projects on iOS devices. Apple of course brings its iOS expertise to the table. Accenture comes into play because it understands how to connect to legacy backend systems that are lurking inside every large enterprise organization. The company has also long worked with established companies that are trying to become digital operations. Both of these are targets for the new project.
Ten years after the iPhone debuted, there are more in-house iOS programmers and more mobile development projects than ever before, but companies have struggled to take advantage of iOS to build digital tools to truly transform organizations and how they operate, according to Susan Prescott, VP for apps, markets and services at Apple.
“We’ve seen an increase in development efforts within companies. In fact, in the last three years, the number of in-house iOS developers has doubled,” she said. “So the demand is definitely there, but enterprises still need great partners to reinvent workflows and tap into backend systems.”
She adds, “This partnership with Accenture is about taking that further. What’s really exciting is that this isn’t just about optimizing existing apps and business processes — it’s about designing new apps and experiences using new technologies.”
Apple is looking to work directly with Accenture and enterprise customers to help them dig into enterprise data, and find new workflows that they have never considered before. This isn’t unlike what it has been doing (and continues to do) with IBM, but Apple says it’s going to have a seat at the table with Accenture personnel and share their expertise around iOS to help solve unique enterprise problems — and that is a big difference with this project.
As for Accenture, Gene Reznick, senior managing director for technology ecosystem and ventures for the firm, says they are looking to capitalize on some specific areas with this partnership including helping to create “engaging user experiences.” They hope to improve how organizations interact with customers in a digital way, something that continues to elude many companies. Secondly, they want to make that experience as meaningful as possible by building connections to relevant back-end systems and surfacing helpful data.
While this could take many forms, they see exploiting the burgeoning area of Internet of Things, where they could build iOS applications to help monitor large industrial machines or other complex operations from an iPad or iPhone. They could supplement this idea by building augmented reality applications with Apple’s AR development toolset, ARKit to help with training or repair assistance right on the iOS device.
For starters, the teams will work together in San Francisco, but the hope is that over time, they will expand the project and build additional teams at some subset of the 30 Accenture Studios located throughout the world.",2017-08-29,1532738,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_8960.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"partnerships,accenture,ios,apple-inc",Apple and Accenture teaming up to help enterprises build advanced mobility tools,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/apple-and-accenture-teaming-up-to-help-enterprises-build-advanced-mobility-tools/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Pivotal, VMware and Google have teamed up on a containerization project that the companies say should simplify creating, deploying and managing container projects at scale.
The companies are taking what is a set of open-source products and providing a commercial underpinning with the various parties in the partnership bringing the product to market. Google will sell it as part of the Google Cloud Platform. Pivotal and VMware will have their sales teams selling it, and Dell-EMC (which owns Pivotal and VMware) could be selling it with their hardware offerings in a package.
Let’s start by breaking down the roles here: Google brings Kubernetes to the table, the open-source container orchestration tool. Pivotal adds the Platform as a Service piece with Cloud Foundry and VMware adds a management layer to pull it all together.
Pivotal gets the naming rights as it’s called Pivotal Container Service. That’s PKS for short, because I guess they don’t understand the concept of an acronym. Regardless, the companies have banded together to deliver “production-ready Kubernetes” on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with ensured ongoing compatibility with Google Container Engine, which you guessed it, has the acronym GKE. ¯(ツ)/¯
The product is actually based on Kubo, an open-source container management product created by Google and Pivotal. With PKS, the idea is to provide a familiar container development environment on Cloud Foundry for developers used to working with Kubernetes.
VMware is the underlying management layer that allows operations to deploy containers and manage the entire container lifecycle. When you put it all together, this becomes an enterprise-class container creation, deployment and management system.
Google Cloud VP of product marketing Sam Ramji says when he was running the Cloud Foundry Foundation before coming to Google last year, he was already seeing Cloud Foundry as the easiest way to get containers into production, and they were thinking about how to get it to work with Kubernetes even then.
Meanwhile, James Waters from Pivotal was seeing many large customers using Google Cloud tools with Pivotal tools and the need for Kubernetes in the tool kit became readily apparent as it grew in popularity.
As for VMware, Sanjay Poonen says they were seeing large customers thinking about containers with Cloud Foundry as a container development environment just as Kubernetes was gaining momentum as the container orchestration engine.
All of that, combined with the interconnections between the three companies, put them on a course to build this new product together. It will be available sometime in the fourth quarter this year.",2017-08-29,1532627,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-455477939.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"kubernetes,google-cloud-platform,pivotal,vmware",Pivotal-VMware-Google forge container partnership,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/pivotal-vmware-google-partner-on-container-project/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"When VMware announced it was partnering with AWS last fall, it turned more than a few enterprise heads. After all, we’re talking about one company that dominates virtual machines on-prem, and the other in the public cloud. Together, the two companies make a powerful combination — and VMware made the whole shebang official today at VMworld when it announced that VMware Cloud was live on AWS.
While AWS runs its own VMs, it’s not the same as those that VMware runs in a data center, and that creates a management headache for companies trying to run both. By letting companies move to AWS and continue to run the VMware VMs in the public cloud, they get the best of both worlds without the management problems.
It should be a boon to both companies, a fact that wasn’t lost on VMWare CEO Pat Gelsinger or AWS CEO Andy Jassy. “VMware Cloud on AWS gives customers a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud that delivers the same architecture, capabilities and operational experience across both their vSphere-based on-premises environment and AWS,” Gelsinger said in a statement.
Jassy added, “The majority of the world’s enterprises have virtualized their data centers with VMware, and now these customers can easily move applications between their on-premises environments and AWS without having to purchase any new hardware, rewrite their applications, or modify their operations.”
All of this is good news for IT pros, who have struggled to make the two systems work together. That generally meant they would could put new applications in the cloud, but struggled to move legacy applications from VMware to the AWS VMs. That obstacle is removed with this alliance.
This partnership is a huge lift for VMware as a company. While they boast almost 100 percent penetration in on-prem data centers, the company has struggled over the last five years to find its place as customers began to shift workloads to the cloud. This gives them a way to integrate with AWS, the giant in the public cloud, and work smoothly across both environments.
As for AWS, it’s a case of the rich getting richer. It gets all of the public cloud business it was getting anyway, while also getting the VMware business as it moves to the cloud. Any way you slice it, this is a win-win-win. Both companies get a big boost, and so do the customers who get a product that makes it easier to integrate VMware VMs in the AWS cloud. Everybody gets a trophy.",2017-08-28,1532284,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/aws-vmware.png?w=738,enterprise/,"andy-jassy,aws,vmware",VMware Cloud is now live on AWS — and IT pros just did a little happy dance,amazon,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/vmware-cloud-is-now-live-on-aws-and-it-pros-just-did-a-little-happy-dance/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"VMware, the company that gave rise to the virtual machine concept in the enterprise data center, announced a series of products and services today at VMworld in Las Vegas that show a company clearly shifting to managing hybrid environments.
The hybrid strategy really began to gain momentum last year when the company forged agreements with the top public cloud vendors including Microsoft, Google and IBM, and most importantly, market leader AWS. This showed that VMware finally understood that the best way forward wasn’t to try and forge its own public cloud product, which it tried and failed, or to fight the public cloud. It was a recognition that most established enterprise companies were probably not going to be all on-prem or all in the public cloud, but a mix of the two for some time into the future.
Today’s announcements at VMworld are about extending that strategy and offering customers a stack of tools to help manage their hybrid cloud world. The partnerships with the public vendors last year were a big part of laying the groundwork for what they presenting today.
The approach could work, at least for the foreseeable future as the industry shift to cloud computing has happened much more slowly than many (including me) would have anticipated. Companies working in a hybrid world face a myriad of challenges around areas like networking, security and policy management across environments, says Chris Wolf, CTO at VMware, and his company is lining up to help with a set of products designed to manage the complexity of a hybrid approach.
This includes the new VMware Discover product, which is designed to give IT insight into all of the applications and services being used across the company with the idea of providing some control over what’s happening across its networks and in the public cloud (with or without its knowledge). This could be used in conjunction with VMware Cost Insight to more closely monitor the costs of these services.
In addition, there is a new security product called VMware AppDefense, which is designed to help understand the normal state of the network, then report on anomalous behavior. There is a cloud-based network monitoring tool called VMware Network Insight that helps set consistent network and security policies across applications in the public cloud and on-prem, while VMware NSX Cloud is a cloud service for managing traffic across the public clouds and a software defined data center. Finally, the company has an analytics service to supply detailed insight into performance across environments.
While none of these tools are ground-breaking by any means, they give VMware a comprehensive set of solutions for customers to manage their hybrid environments, and continue the shift from their core virtual machine roots.
Keep in mind, they are hardly alone in coming up with this approach. This is a similar strategy being employed by other legacy vendors including IBM, HPE, Red Hat and corporate parent Dell/EMC — VMware is an independent, publicly traded entity that is part of the Dell/EMC federation.",2017-08-28,1532059,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-532029221-1.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"hybrid-cloud,vmworld,virtual-machines,vmware",VMware expands hybrid cloud strategy with series of announcements at VMworld,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/vmware-expands-hybrid-cloud-strategy-with-series-of-announcements-at-vmworld/
Ron Miller,Artificial Intelligence,"Content management is about to undergo a foundational shift as artificial intelligence and machine learning bring long-sought order to enterprise content. As the volume of content has increased, the ability to manage it all seems to have eluded us. Ironic, since Content Management Systems were supposed to solve the enterprise content organization problem.
The paradox was that the more content you collected, the harder it was to manage. AI and machine learning have the power to change that because machine learning algorithms actually work better with more data, and that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we think about managing content.
That could be why Box CEO Aaron Levie thinks AI could have a bigger impact on content management than even cloud computing did a decade ago. “I think it’s going to be more fundamental than the cloud in terms of its impact across all enterprise software, but specifically in our space, cloud content management.” He believes that’s precisely because of the exponential increase in the amount of data that is being created and shared internally and externally today by organizations of all sizes.
“The only way we are going to be able to make sense of all this data and to extract more and more value from it is through machine learning and artificial intelligence. There is simply no other way to keep up with the growing [deluge] of data, as well as the use cases around this content,” he said.
Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that just this month, Box announced a partnership with Google to bring AI via image recognition technology to the cloud content management firm. Specifically, it adds intelligence by auto-tagging pictures at upload and capturing any text within the pictures, making easier to identify and find pictures later on without human intervention.
“We looked at what problem could we first solve with AI. Within Box we have 30 billion files now, and a significant portion of those are image files, and so we wanted something that instantly was going to create a tremendous amount of value for our customers. That’s why we decided to work with Google on the computer vision service,” Levie explained.
Box also announced a deepening partnership with Microsoft in June and suggested that it could include taking advantage of Azure AI and machine learning algorithms.
At the time, Jeetu Patel, Box’s SVP of Platform and chief strategy officer, told TechCrunch the very nature of content management was about to shift in a significant way. “In the next five years, the way people engage and interact with content will be completely different than the last 25 years with new ways to engage and extract meaning [from content]…” Patel said.
Last week, M-Files, a hybrid content management solution, announced it was acquiring Apprento, a Canadian startup that uses natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) to provide semantically based intelligent summaries. Greg Milliken, SVP of Marketing at M-Files, says the Apprento purchase gives them an immediate way to process unstructured data in an intelligent way.
“In Apprento’s case, we were first attracted to their practical experience with applying natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) to practical business needs. For instance, analyzing the language used in emails and other unstructured documents and content to establish context and intent, such as relationships to accounts, projects and cases, ultimately making them easy to find when they are most relevant and needed.”
All of these moves suggest that we could be in the midst of an industry shift that Levie and Patel alluded to, as content management firms try to use intelligence to make sense of the increasingly large amount of content moving into the enterprise.
Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been covering this industry for many years, sees AI having great utility. “It’s finding its way into content management in many different ways — content analytics, automated governance, but maybe most interesting through RPA (Robotic Process Automation). RPA is far from sexy, but it can have an immediate impact on the bottom line so it’s important,” he said.
He says the moves by M-Files and Box are probably just the beginning and we should expect to see more partnership and acquisition action as companies take a deeper dive into AI. “I see many acquisitions and partnerships happening over the next year or two with [companies seeking] AI specialists for particular needs. Box is partnering, but I don’t think that rules out acquisitions (though they tend to buy small) to use the learning and automation technologies in different parts of their platforms — and similarly for different [types of] customers,” he said.
For his part, Levie says that his company will pursue whatever course seems to make the most sense, developing in-house when needed and partnering when a viable solution already exists, as it did with Google’s computer vision technology. (He did not discuss acquisition strategy.)
Tony Byrne, founder and principal analyst at Real Story Group, who is usually skeptical about developing tech trends, is actually bullish about using AI in content management — but not without some caveats. He cautions that the usefulness of your AI effort is going to be related to the condition of your data.
“Those sorts of automation and cognitive services typically depend on a fairly organized repository of tagged (and ideally structured) content, which is often what you’re working towards in an ECM project in any case. The challenge comes for customers who have very messy repositories: AI/ML isn’t going to clean it up for them, and [these companies] will struggle to draw meaningful conclusions — garbage in — garbage out,” Byrne explained.
Pelz-Sharpe agrees with this assessment. “Most enterprises have poorly managed data/files — unintegrated applications and are typically (intentionally or not) out of compliance. AI promises to figure that out for you. In reality, though AI is itself limited in what it can do due to this poor state of affairs,” he said.
Byrne also warned that it’s early days and it’s going to take some time to get this right. “Customers just need to understand that software vendors themselves are still thinking in terms of potential and have not yet fully activated AI/ML services as specific applications. That means that [customers] today will need to do a lot of the experimentation and testing themselves. But I think it’s worth exploring, especially for sizable enterprises with more complex needs around large-scale document processing, knowledge management, records management and search tuning,” he said.
That is good advice for any developing technology, but especially worth keeping in mind with the unique needs of content management. That means finding areas where it would work best such as Box’s choice of image recognition. Over time, as AI improves and gets more deeply incorporated into CMS tech, we will begin to see more complex use cases.
Levie acknowledged that a lot of this technology will likely be applied to future content, rather than large legacy stores, but that shouldn’t minimize the impact this is going to have on the industry moving forward.
As AI and machine learning evolve, it makes sense that content management is going to play a role in that. Humans have never been terribly skillful at organizing massive volumes of data — and it turns out, machines are amazingly adept at it. As we have begun to see with other forms of enterprise software like CRM, AI is transforming the entire way we think about software.
“We think we are on the cusp of, for the first time, where technology can actually work on behalf of the user. I don’t have to tell it to do all of the things I want to generate value from. The system itself can begin to generate that value on its own, and that’s a pretty significant turning point for technology,” Levie said.
This ability could allow us to finally fulfill the promise of managing and controlling large volumes of content. “It finally introduces the promise that the industry has been talking about for a couple of decades. It has never been about the storage and archiving and strict management of the content. It’s always been about how do you make sense of and create more value from your information, but unfortunately, we’ve never actually had the technology to be able to accomplish that ultimate vision…until now,” Levie aptly explained.",2017-08-26,1531721,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-493602229-1.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"aaron-levie,content-management-systems",AI will fundamentally change how we manage content,box,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/ai-will-fundamentally-change-how-we-manage-content/
John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"Descartes Labs is announcing a $30 million Series B this morning in a large round led by March Capital. This comes just three months after one of Descartes’ largest competitors, Orbital Insight, closed its own $50 million Series C with Sequoia.
Both Descartes and Orbital are playing in the emerging market of geospatial analytics. These companies use machine learning to produce insights from satellite imagery and other data. This capability has proved exceedingly popular with hedge funds where images of store parking lots, for example, can be used to project out revenue numbers. But companies running the gamut from agriculture to logistics see the value in having an extra pair of trained eyes in the sky.
Most of Descartes previous investors participated in today’s growth round. Crosslink Capital and Cultivian Sandbox participated though Data Collective did not. The company previously raised $8.3 million in funding.
Right out of the gate, one of the more unique things about Descartes is that it is headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Co-founder Mark Johnson pitched Santa Fe to me as a place where an engineer and his or her family can actually buy a house. Today’s raise is one of the largest in the history of New Mexico.
“Our original founding thesis was that lots of money was going to satellite hardware but not to the equivalent software,” Johnson explained to me in an interview.
In the three years since, more money than ever has been spent on geospatial software technologies. Johnson noted the number of startups he meets on a weekly basis trying to do interesting things combining deep learning and the myriad of images taken from different satellites every day continues to grow.
As Descartes’ internal data pipelines have been getting more and more robust, talk has slowly shifted to opening up the platform to a wider audience. Everyone in the space knows that the real money will be made through massive SaaS contracts and not through one-off consulting contracts.
The hope is that Descartes can open up all of its technology in an easy to use way such that customers can search across the globe. Geovisual Search was an initial crack at this — implementing computer vision to quantify physical infrastructure. With this tool, you can search for wastewater treatment plants or cargo ships and automatically count and identify them.
The biggest challenge is getting companies into a position where they can get the most out of using Descartes’ platform. Extracting data, cleaning it and thinking about data science methodologies isn’t always the easiest thing to do. This is the main reason that Descartes is prioritizing accessibility.
Today the startup has 40 employees. Johnson is looking to grow the team to around 50 or 60 by the end of the year and 100 next year. Much of this hiring will happen in product and sales. The team is toying with the idea of increasing the number of verticalized offerings — in the near future you could hypothetically see a dedicated platform for agriculture with built-in land use classifications.",2017-08-24,1531111,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-24-at-10-05-20-am.png?w=738,enterprise/,"orbital-insight,orbit,descartes-labs,philosophy",Descartes Labs raises $30 million Series B for its brand of geospatial analytics,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/descartes-labs-raises-30-million-series-b-for-its-brand-of-geospatial-analytics/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Google got a much-needed win today when Marketo, the marketing automation platform, chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to migrate its entire on-prem operation.
The partnership will extend beyond hosting with Google also providing deeper integration with GSuite. Google says that should enable Marketo customers to generate content and communicate with customers directly from the Marketo platform using Google tools like Gmail, Sheets and Hangouts Chat.
In addition, Marketo plans to use Google BigQuery for advanced analytics and Google’s machine learning APIs with the goal of providing better marketing insights for its customers.
The company points out in a blog post announcing the win, that it has relationships with other SaaS vendors including Evernote, which also moved its entire on-prem operation to GCP earlier this year in a massive three-petabyte migration.
Just last week, Box announced it was partnering with Google for image recognition using Google’s Cloud Vision service.
Google has been playing catch-up in the cloud as it stares up at AWS in first place. Microsoft has taken the bulk of the remainder of the market share, while Google remains far behind. Despite being born in the cloud, and running a massive cloud operation, it took Google quite a long time to start taking Infrastructure as a Service seriously.

It really began making a concerted push when it hired Diane Greene to run GCP at the end of 2015, more than 9 years after Amazon launched AWS. Since then, the company has been trying to position itself as the more developer-friendly open platform and attempting to attract more enterprise customers.
As Greene pointed out in an interview last year, in spite of the fact the cloud has been around for over a decade, it’s still early days, and there is still plenty of marketshare to be had. She’s not wrong about that.
In an interview last year at the University of Washington, AWS CEO Andy Jassy admitted he was surprised it took so long for the competition to catch on, but now that it has, Jassy said he sees room for more than one winner.
Google certainly hopes so, and it needs all of the wins it can get this point, as it tries to catch up with the competition.

Jordan Crook,Apps,"Tinder has hit number 1 in the App Store’s top grossing category for the very first time.
Claiming top spot in the App Store likely has to do with the global launch of Tinder Gold, which lets users see who has liked them without swiping at all, among other premium features.
Tinder’s initial foray into monetization came in 2015 with the launch of Tinder Plus, which lets users “Rewind” on accidental left swipes and includes the “Passport” feature, letting users search outside of their current geographical radius.
The company has since added new revenue models, such as advertising within the feed. Plus also includes a limited amount of a la carte paid features, such as Super Like and Tinder Boost. Super Like lets you notify someone you really like that you’re into them before they even swipe on you, marking your profile with a big blue star. Tinder Boost, on the other hand, lets you skip the line and jump to the front of other users’ feeds as they browse the dating service.
While Tinder Gold was in testing in a handful of markets for the past month, the company officially rolled out Tinder Gold worldwide on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Tinder topped the Top Grossing category of the App Store.
App Annie says that dating apps made up one-third of the top 15 apps by iOS revenue yesterday, along with video and music streaming apps. The analytics service also said that Tinder has been in the top 15 iOS apps by daily revenue throughout all of 2017, and hung in the top 10 for July and August.",2017-09-01,1535140,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tinder-gold.jpg?w=738,social/,"app-annie,ios,tinder-gold",Tinder hits top grossing app in the App Store on heels of Tinder Gold launch,tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/tinder-hits-top-grossing-app-in-the-app-store-on-heels-of-tinder-gold-launch/
Sarah Perez,Social,"Twitch today is introducing a suite of tools called Twitch Extensions that will allow its streamers to customize their channel pages with interactive features, including polls, leaderboards, tickers, schedules, overlays and even virtual pets, among other things. Beyond simply personalizing their channel to make it more engaging to fans, the extensions in some cases will help streamers generate additional revenue.
In particular, one extension called “Gear on Amazon” allows Twitch creators to show off their favorite Amazon products. If a viewer clicks through to purchase, the creator will earn a commission through the Amazon Associates program.

This extension will be available to both Twitch Partners and Affiliates, and is the first time that Twitch’s streamers have been invited to join the program, even though Amazon owns Twitch. To create their list of suggested products, streamers will be able to sign up as an Amazon Affiliate, then browse the Amazon catalog and pick their favorite products, right from their Twitch dashboard, the company says.
This follows another recent move from Amazon to help video creators make money by promoting Amazon products, as it turns out. Last week, Amazon opened up its social media “Influencers” program to YouTube stars, allowing video creators to build their own curated shop, with its own short and memorable URL. It only makes sense that Amazon would enable something similar for its Twitch streamers, as well.
“When it comes to helping creators monetize through product recommendations, it’s important
to make these features easy to discover and intuitive to use,” said Piers Heaton-Armstrong, VP
for Affiliate Marketing at Amazon, in a statement. “Gear on Amazon achieves that by simplifying both the process for signing up to be an Amazon Associate and by making it so creators can showcase the actual products they are using and wanting to promote,” he said.

However, the Amazon extension is only one of many that will be available at launch. There are currently over 20 extensions available, including some game-specific ones like OP.gg forLeague of Legends by OP.gg, Innkeeper: Interactive Hearth Overlay by Curse, andMasterOverwatch by Master Network.
Others are designed for more general use, like Streamlabs’ Loyalty, Music, Polls & Games, or Muxy’s Overlay and Leaderboard, for example.
A full list of the new extensions is available on the Twitch blog here. A sample showcase is below.
Twitch is also opening up the extension platform broadly to third-party developers, via its Developer Portal, dev.twtich.tv. Developers will receive free asset hosting and fanout messaging to make it easier to get started, the company says. Completed extensions are then shown to creators in a new Extension Manager.
At launch, extensions will be free, but Twitch tells us that monetization details are soon to come. More information about this will be announced at Twitch’s developer conference, TwitchCon’s Developer Day next month.
Twitch had planned to make the extensions available to streamers tonight, but that’s been pushed back at the last minute. Instead, the company now says the extensions will be “coming soon.”",2017-08-31,1534727,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-3-51-26-pm1.png?w=738,social/,"gaming,gamers,streaming","Twitch’s new extensions let streamers customize their channel, make money from Amazon sales",twitch,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/twitchs-new-extensions-let-streamers-customize-their-channel-make-money-from-amazon-sales/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Microsoft’s mobile game streaming app Mixer Create is launching out of beta testing today on iOS and Android, allowing gamers to broadcast the games they’re playing right from their phone. This feature works on Android with all games, but is more limited on iOS. On iPhone, select games that have enabled Apple’s ReplayKit functionality will work, the company notes.
That means games like Star Trek Timelines, Goat Simulator, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, and others will be supported.
The app can also be used for co-streaming, which allows up to four streamers to combine their streams into a single viewing experience, Microsoft says in its announcement. In the new app, there’s now an invitations feature that’s partially functional for now. Currently, you can accept or reject the pop-up co-stream invites, but in a few months, you’ll be able to send out these co-stream invites as well.
Gamers can also use the app for non-gaming related purposes, too – like vlogging through a feature that lets them ‘go live’ at any time to initiate a real-time broadcast to their fans.
Plus, streamers can interact with viewers in their channel’s chat interface when broadcasting, as they could on PC or Xbox.
This includes access to moderation tools as well. Some gamers may choose to use the Mixer Create app for chat, while streaming from their computer or console, Microsoft suggests.
The launch comes shortly after rival Twitch debuted an updated streaming app of its own, which included the ability to live stream from mobile devices to their channels. Like Microsoft, Twitch is also working to expand beyond gaming to allow its streamers to broadcast other content, including personal updates and other artistic endeavours.
While Microsoft has some features gamers want, its traction in the streaming market still lags behind both Twitch and YouTube in terms of reach. According to a recent study by Streamlabs, Twitch has a much larger chunk of the streaming market, ahead of YouTube in second place. Microsoft, Periscope and Facebook Live had only slivers.

However, Mixer (a startup that won TechCrunch Disrupt last year, when it was then called Beam), is still a relatively new entry to this market, and could catch up in time, or at least increase its share.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Instagram Stories, its Snapchat clone now used by daily more people than Snapchat itself, is coming to the web. Initially, the feature will allow desktop and mobile web users to view Stories posted by their friends and others they follow. But it in the months ahead, the web version will allow you to post to Stories, too.
Instagram Stories has been only one of an array of attacks on rival Snapchat – along with a dedicated app for teens, Facebook Stories, Messenger Day, and more. But it’s the one that stuck. Today, the feature alone is used by over 250 million Instagram users every day, while Snapchat reports it has grown its total user base to a lesser 173 million daily users.
Though there’s been some backlash about the “Stories” format showing up everywhere these days – from Facebook to Skype and even on dating apps – on Instagram, it makes more sense. The photo-based social network is already about using visual communication as a means of connecting with friends.

And with Stories, Instagram has efficiently copied some of Snapchat’s best party tricks, including augmented reality filters, face filters, sticker packs, ephemeral messaging, and more.
As in the mobile app, Instagram Stories will appear at the top of the page when viewed on the web. You can click into a Story to view it, then tap on the small arrow icons to advance or go back.
The move to bring Stories to the web may seem relatively minor, but it broadens access to the feature, including in developing markets. Over 80% of Instagram’s base is outside the U.S., the company notes. And this expanded reach, in turn, impacts Instagram’s bottom line.
Instagram today is home to a number of businesses who want to market to consumers through their own Instagram accounts and ads, and one in five Instagram Stories posted by a business received a Direct Message reply. That could make it appealing to advertisers who want to reach customers through more private channels.
Instagram says that Stories on the web is rolling out starting today, but the process won’t complete for weeks. Posting to Stories from the web will follow in the months ahead.",2017-08-31,1534430,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/instagram-stories-desktop-web.png?w=738,social/,stories,Instagram Stories are coming to the web,"snapchat,facebook,instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/instagram-stories-are-coming-to-the-web/
Jordan Crook,Apps,"As Rafiki once said, “It is time.”
Tinder Gold, the dating app’s new premium subscription tier (which includes a feature that lets you see who’s already liked you without any swiping) is finally rolling out to the U.S.
Tinder Gold and Likes You were originally tested in Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico at the end of June. Today, however, the the feature rolls out to all Tinder users across the globe.
One of Tinder’s greatest obstacles has always been balancing the game of Tinder with the utility of Tinder. Those who were actually looking for a romantic endeavor were often inundated with matches that were simply swiping for the sake of swiping. In fact, before Likes You, the only way Tinder users had access to everyone that liked them was to swipe right on everyone.
Tinder’s Right Swipe Limiter worked well to curb that, but Likes You is a great way to make some cash on the back’s of users’ insatiable curiosity.
The company says that more than 1.6 billion swipes go down on Tinder each day around the world.
“Some users have a lot of time to spend swiping and connecting with new people, but we’ve found that others want to maximize the time they’re able to spend on the app, and Likes You gives those users a way to swipe, match, and start chatting seamlessly,” said Tinder Chief Product Officer Brian Norgard. “Tinder Gold provides subscribers with the fun and engaging swiping experience they love about Tinder, coupled with the efficiency and control of being able to see who’s swiped right on them first.”
Tinder Gold includes many of the Tinder Plus features, such as Passport, Rewind, Unlimited Likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and other profile controls. And you can’t forget Likes You.
Tinder Gold pricing is still being tested, but the current price is $4.99/month. The company told Buzzfeed that, during testing in other countries, your average Tinder Gold user received around 60 percent more matches compared to free Tinder users.",2017-08-29,1532912,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/tindermatch.jpeg?w=738,social/,tinder-gold,"Tinder Gold, which lets you see who has liked you, launches today in U.S.",tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/tinder-gold-which-lets-you-see-who-has-liked-you-launches-today-in-u-s/
Anthony Ha,Advertising Tech,"Facebook says it’s taking another step against Pages that share fabricated news stories.
The company has already been working with outside fact-checkers like Snopes and the AP to flag inaccurate news stories. (These aren’t supposed to be stories that are disputed for reasons of opinion or partisanship, but rather outright hoaxes and lies.) It also says that when a story is marked as disputed, the link can can no longer be promoted through Facebook ads.
The next step, which the company is announcing today, involves stopping Pages that regularly share these stories from buying any Facebook ads at all, regardless of whether or not the ad includes a disputed link.
Facebook was criticized last year for its role in helping to spread of fake/false news. (The company is using the term “false news” for now — “fake news” has become heavily politicized and almost meaningless.) Product Director Rob Leathern said the company has been trying to fight back in three ways — ending the economic incentive to post false news stories, slowing the spread of those stories and helping people make more informed decisions when they see a false story.
In this case, Leathern said blocking ad-buying is meant to change the economic incentives. Facebook is concerned that “there are Pages posting this information that are using Facebook Ads to build audiences” to spread false news. By changing the ad policy, Facebook makes it harder for companies to attract that audience.
Facebook isn’t specifying the exact numbers of disputed links a Page can share before it gets blocked — after all, the company doesn’t want people to try to game the system — but Leathern said, “Obviously, it’s not a single instance. It’s a repeated pattern of misinformation.”
He also noted that the ban on buying ads isn’t necessarily permanent. If a Page stops sharing false stories, it should eventually be able to buy ads again.",2017-08-28,1532280,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fb-arbiter-of-truth.png?w=738,social/,,Facebook says Pages that regularly share false news won’t be able to buy ads,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/facebook-fake-news-ads/
Anthony Ha,Media,"Facebook says it’s looking to become more open and transparent about its decisions, and it’s hired Liz Spayd, a former public editor of The New York Times, to consult on the process.
The hire comes as Facebook — or at least, parts of Facebook — seems to be wrestling with its role in the public sphere. There have been specific controversies, like the debate over Facebook’s role in spreading fake news (which the company has been doing more to fight), as well as a broader conversation around what responsibility Facebook has toward its 2 billion users.
One of the ways Facebook has tried to open up about these issues is through a series of blog posts around “Hard Questions,” like how Facebook addresses hate speech and what happens to people’s profiles after they die.
These posts are usually written by Facebook employees, but a spokesperson told me Spayd has been working for the past few weeks to help with Hard Questions and potentially to bring that same approach to transparency to other parts of the company.
In some ways, Spayd might seem perfect for that role — as The Times’ public editor,  she served as a sort of intermediary between readers and the newsroom. However, her columns were often controversial. Slate’s Will Oremus probably did the best job of laying out the case against her, arguing that she was “squandering the most important watchdog job in journalism” by parroting journalistic platitudes and reader complaints without thoughtful analysis.
Spayd turned out to be the last public editor at The Times, at least for now — the position was eliminated as part of larger editorial cuts.
Beyond her work as public editor, Spayd has a long journalistic résumé, including serving as editor of the Columbia Journalism Review and managing editor of the Washington Post. Her hiring was first reported by Recode.",2017-08-25,1531732,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-512015962.jpg?w=738,social/,liz-spayd,Facebook hires former NYT public editor Liz Spayd to consult on transparency,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/facebook-hires-liz-spayd/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Wattpad, the social publishing platform behind apps for sharing original stories and chat fiction, is today venturing into video with the launch of a new app called Raccoon. Unlike its predecessors, Raccoon will focus on non-fiction video-based storytelling, with the goal of connecting people who want to create and watch stories that either entertain or inspire.
While Raccoon still fits within Wattpad’s broader mission of building modern-day storytelling products for web and mobile, the app feels like a more social experience. Instead of reading stories from authors whose real identities are often hidden behind handles, watching a Raccoon video is more like tuning into a YouTube vlog. The storyteller is right there on the screen, sharing something personal with you.
At launch, you can favorite stories by tapping a heart, or post them outside the app by clicking the share button, but Raccoon (perhaps smartly) doesn’t offer a commenting feature at this time.

If you want to participate in the community by posting your own video, you can click the plus sign at the bottom of the app to start recording. For those who aren’t sure what to talk about, there’s also an “I need inspiration” button that offers a story prompt.
Each week, there are new story challenges in the form of prompts. For example, this week, Raccoon is prompting users to share their travel stories. If the weekly challenge isn’t of interest, you can swipe left for more ideas, like “what’s unique about your family?,” “share a memorable childhood experience,” “share your biggest Tinder-fail,” “share a funny story that happened at work,” etc.

These stories are tagged, so you can find more of the same while browsing the app.
While recording, you can see when your video hits the 60-second mark – a subtle reminder that Raccoon wants videos that are only a minute or two long.
The app was developed out of Wattpad’s internal incubator, Wattpad Labs, which is also where its newer chat fiction app Tap got off the ground. Today, that app is the #7 app in the Books category on the App Store, just a couple of spots behind Wattpad itself. It has since grown to include over 300,000 stories. Meanwhile, Wattpad’s monthly audience is now 60 million.
However, both Wattpad apps on the App Store are trailing two other top chat fiction apps, Hooked and Yarn.
“Wattpad’s vision is to entertain and connect the world through stories, and as part of this we are constantly looking for innovative ways to evolve the storytelling process,” explains company co-founder Ivan Yuen about Wattpad’s move into video. “We know that video will play an important role in the future of storytelling and wanted to create a place where storytellers can authentically connect with audiences around shared experiences,” he adds.
The new app is designed to appeal to those aged 18 to 35. This age group, Yuen says, is already accustomed to the Snapchat’s and Musical.ly’s short, vertical video format, but are craving “more substance and meaningful connections with people,” he believes.
Raccoon has been in testing in Canada ahead of today’s launch. The app is now available in the U.S. on both iOS and Android.",2017-08-25,1531473,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/raccoon-ios-alt.jpg?w=738,social/,"apps,video,social,wattpad","Wattpad moves into video with personal storytelling app, Raccoon",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/wattpad-moves-into-video-with-personal-storytelling-app-raccoon/
Josh Constine,Apps,"What if you could see if your Instagrams made people happy, surprised or disgusted? That’s just one of the innovative features of new photo-sharing social network Polygram. Using facial detection, Polygram gives you analytics about the emotional reactions people have to the photos you post.
Polygram also has augmented reality makeup that lets you look more attractive instead of just silly like with masks in other apps. Plus, it’s developed a smart method of preventing screenshots where you can cover your photos like a fogged-up window, and people may only wipe clean a portion of the screen at a time.
After raising $2.1 million in seed funding, today Polygram launches its iOS app with dreams of usurping Instagram and Snapchat.

It will be a tough uphill climb, especially if the social giants copy Polygram’s emotion detection and other cool features. But co-founder Faryar Ghazanfari thinks it can grow by attracting users who want to A/B test their social media with Polygram’s facial analytics to pick what to post elsewhere.
“Influencers and content creators are the oxygen in this ecosystem,” Ghazanfari tells me. “We have white glove service for influencers, with full-time employees that just create custom features for them.” If the app can deliver enough utility and views, he thinks people might start purposefully sharing on Polygram too.
I met Ghazanfari at TechCrunch’s annual summer August Capital party. He asked about a story I wrote about Facebook acquiring a company called FacioMetrics that had researched letting you Like photos by smiling, then claimed his fledgling startup Polygram had actually built that. The demo was impressive.
With just a minimal 20 milliseconds of lag, Polygram shows a wireframe mirror of your face that recognizes a wide variety of emotions corresponding to different emoji. It relies on an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to detect how your face moves and map it to a specific emotion. As I smiled, frowned and raised my eyebrows, Polygram accurately surfaced the related emoji.

This tech is the basis of Polygram’s Instagram-ish social network. When sent a private message, you can respond with a face-triggered emoji reaction. And when you post a photo, you’ll see the emotional response tallies of your audience, though without names attached so you can’t get mad at a friend for looking grossed-out by your selfie. You also can see exactly where around the world your viewers are, and get audience breakdowns by demographic if you only care how a certain gender feels about your post.
Some extra features include the ability to post permanent or ephemeral photos and videos, with the option to make a disappearing image everlasting after you post it. There are the typical Snapchat-style face filters, but there also are more subtle ones designed to beautify you like Meitu instead of making you puke rainbows or look like a puppy.
Perhaps the savviest feature, and the one I almost hope Snapchat or Instagram copies, is Polygram’s “wipe-to-reveal.” It lets you choose to protect your private messages from screenshots.
When delivered, your friend will see a blurry image as if was behind a condensation-covered window. By wiping a finger over the photo, they clear the fog and are shown what’s underneath. But the fog quickly reappears, so only a swath of the photo is visible at a time. With enough wiping, you’ll see and remember the whole image piece by piece, but if you try to screenshot or take a photo with a second camera, only the currently visible section will be recorded. Plus, you’ll be alerted if they screenshot it, and get sent a copy of what they captured.
Starting a new social network from scratch is incredibly difficult. People have already made their connections on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. They loathe the chore of rebuilding this graph, posing a stiff challenge for Polygram.
Ghazanfari hopes to overcome this by recruiting influencers who’ll bring their own audiences with them. He says it’s already signed up a bunch who’ve been helping it refine Polygram’s features, and it wants to give them personal attention that Snapchat has notoriously denied to social media stars. “And in terms of monetization, we put these guys ahead of ourselves,” Ghazanfari declares.
But Polygram will have to sign up plenty of users to watch these web celebs, since they’ll only invest time in a platform that grows their fan base. Even with all its snazzy features, that may prove very tough, especially without much funding for traditional marketing.
Still, if Polygram’s app fails to gain mass traction, I’d bet its slick interface ideas will live on, whether it’s copied or acquired by the social juggernauts.",2017-08-25,1531440,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/polygram-facial-detection.png?w=738,social/,"selfie-masks,polygram",Polygram detects facial reactions to shared photos,"instagram,snapchat",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/polygram/
Sarah Perez,Social,"Facebook today is expanding on the popularity of its two-year old “On This Day” sharing prompt, with the addition of new features that let users revisit their memories, as well as celebrate milestones related to their friendships on the social network. While “On This Day” provides a look back in time, starting with memories from the same day last year, two new options will instead focus on your more recent memories.
The company will now begin to bundle your past posts into monthly or seasonal sharing prompts. For example, you might see recap stories for things like your summer memories or your January memories.
Like “On This Day,” these new sharing prompts are private to you, unless you choose to post them to your Facebook profile. They’ll also appear in your News Feed, where you’ll see the collection of photos Facebook has picked for you along with the “Share” button below.
The recap feature arrives at a time when Facebook is struggling with consumer adoption of its Snapchat Stories clone, which unlike Instagram Stories, has not taken off. Facebook even began showing grayed-out images of friends’ photos earlier this year in Stories, in an effort to increase usage.
Facebook believes that Stories is simply a new sharing format that every network will eventually offer. However, many people think of Facebook as a more permanent record of life events, thanks to its ability surface old memories, search or scroll back through timelines to see historic personal moments, like the date you got married, started a new job, moved to a new home, and so on.
That’s why a recap feature makes more sense for Facebook, as opposed to the recency associated with Stories. It’s a better fit for a network that’s encouraged people from day one to document what matters in their lives, not what’s disposable.

In addition to this, Facebook is also today launching new friendship milestones. While the social network already allows users to celebrate their friendship anniversaries on Facebook with playful posts and videos, these new moments will focus on notable achievements – like when the number of friends you have hits a nice, round number like 100, or when your posts have been liked 1,000 times, for instance.
These messages are shown only to you, and are oddly not shareable at launch. However, Facebook says that will change in the future.
Meanwhile, “On this Day” is now finally available to all on Facebook, the company also says. Facebook has improved its filtering process to keep those memories associated with negative events or feelings from popping up in its suggestions, it notes.

Features like these are minor updates in the grand scheme of things, but they have a larger goal: to keep users posting to Facebook.
Last year, there were reports detailing how Facebook sharing – specifically “organic sharing,” meaning personal updates –  was in decline. Since then, Facebook has made a number of changes to make sharing and participating more engaging, as with the rollout of colored backgrounds for status updates, support for GIFs in comments, among other things.
Facebook says the new features are rolling out now, and will be expanded to include more prompts in the months ahead.",2017-08-25,1531459,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/milestone_3phone_static-1.png?w=738,social/,,Facebook adds new ways to revisit your memories and milestones,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/facebook-adds-new-ways-to-revisit-your-memories-and-milestones/
Natasha Lomas,Social,"Facebook is faced with yet another content-related scandal, after The Times newspaper reported that people traffickers and slave traders are using its platform to broadcast videos of migrants being tortured to try to extort money from their families.
According to the newspaper’s report, footage showing Libyan gangmasters threatening the lives of migrants had remained on the social network for months.
It reports that harrowing footage shared on Facebook showed emaciated and injured migrants, mostly Somalis and Ethiopians, huddled in a concrete cellar describing the abuse they have suffered and pleading for their lives.
The Times quotes a United Nations migration agency criticizing the company for allowing people traffickers to use its site to “advertise their services, entice vulnerable people on the move and then exploit them and their families”.
Mohammed Abdiker, of the International Organisation for Migration, said: “It is irresponsible for tech companies like Facebook to ignore this issue. It’s hard to believe that the tech giants cannot put some real effort into stopping these smugglers from using their platforms for racketeering.”
In one instance the newspaper says a video that had been posted on June 9 was still on the site until yesterday.
Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it had removed some of the content after the Times reported it. In a statement, a spokesperson told us: “Offering services to take part in, support or promote people smuggling on Facebook, violates our Community Standards.”
In an earlier statement to the Times, it added: “People smuggling is illegal and any posts, pages or groups that co-ordinate this activity are not allowed on Facebook. We encourage people to keep using our reporting tools to flag this kind of behaviour so it can be reviewed and swiftly removed by our global team of experts, who work with law enforcement agencies around the world.”
A series of public outcries over content moderation has cranked up the political pressure on Facebook in recent times — ranging from suicides and murders being broadcast via its live streaming service, to extremist propaganda and child abuse content.
It also faces ongoing pressure to speed up hate speech take downs — especially in Europe, where legislators are eyeing fines to enforce action.
In May, faced with rising political pressure on multiple fronts, Facebook announced it would be adding 3,000 additional staff to its content moderation team — expanding it to 7,500. Although for a platform with two billion users globally that’s clearly a drop in the ocean.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also said it’s hope is that developments in AI technology will enable it to automate content moderation at scale in time. Though he also warned such a scenario is likely years out — meanwhile the scandals keep coming. Including, now, an accusation that it is not doing enough to stop people traffickers utilizing its platform to profit from human misery.
The company argues it seeks to balance raising awareness of controversial issues, including from war zones, with taking down content that may be disturbing to users.
A spokesman told us that in this instance, for example, while it has removed abuse videos reported to it by the Times, it has not removed a video report by a Somali journalist covering people smuggling, although it has added a warning to flag the disturbing nature of the content.
“We also believe it is important that Facebook continues to be a place where people can raise awareness of important, and sometimes controversial issues. This specific video was posted to condemn the content, so we would not consider it a violation of our policies. However, the content is alarming, and we have marked the video as disturbing. This means there will be a warning screen and the video’s distribution will be limited to those aged 18 and over,” the spokesperson added.",2017-08-25,1531444,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/facebook-ios-newsletter1.jpg?w=640,social/,"content-moderation,social-media",Facebook faces another moderation scandal over migrant torture videos,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/facebook-faces-another-moderation-scandal-over-migrant-torture-videos/
Devin Coldewey,Diversity,"Adding real-world diversity to emoji is a work in progress, but with platforms spanning the entire globe, it’s clearly important to big companies like Facebook. The social network just rolled out a set of new “family” emoji that, while they don’t yet capture the full spectrum, at least let your partner and kids have something other than yellow skin.
It’s live right now in the desktop and mobile site — but not Messenger, which for some reason uses different emoji, or the mobile app. All you have to do is pull down the emoji menu, then do a long click on the family emoji — your options should appear above the default yellow-skinned emoji.
So why did this take so long? Well, standards take a while to set, and the UTF standard for modifying the skin color of emoji had to be developed and agreed upon. And once that happens, it’s up to platforms how they want to implement that standard.
In this case, it was Microsoft that jumped on the possibility of diverse family emoji first — more than a year ago. But see if you can spot the difference between the ones above and Microsoft’s:
Yeah — diversity is complicated! Families frequently aren’t all black, all brown, or all yellow. Reflecting real diversity in families is different from doing so with individuals. And the encoding process is different, too.
	
There’s an existing code grammar for this, but it isn’t well supported — if you saw one of their complex families on other platforms, it wouldn’t render properly. Instead it shows as a sequence of each person in the family — actually a rather graceful failure.
Anyway, back to Facebook. They’re all about ease of use, and having 52,000 options pop up in the emoji menu isn’t a good user experience. So for now the social network opted to keep things monochrome in a fashion, though less monochrome than they were before. Yellow faces may be a decent alternative for people whose skin tone actually resembles it, but people with darker skin will surely appreciate this option, even if it isn’t comprehensive yet.
I’ve asked Facebook if it plans to add multi-tone families any time soon, and I’ll update this if I hear back.",2017-08-24,1531136,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/dark-skin-emoji.jpg?w=738,social/,emoji,"Facebook adds skin tones to family emoji, but it’s complicated",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/facebook-adds-skin-tones-to-family-emoji-but-its-complicated/
Sarah Perez,eCommerce,"Amazon’s Influencer Program, a service that allows social media personalities to earn commissions on the Amazon products they promote, is now accepting sign-ups from YouTube influencers who want to participate. Last Thursday, Amazon quietly enabled a self-service tool for YouTube stars that lets them request to join the highly-vetted program, which had first launched into beta in late March.
The Influencer Program, until now, has been operating in a closed beta. Social media influencers could apply to the program by filling out an online form.
These applications were vetted, as Amazon considered factors like the size of the influencer’s online following, fan engagement on their posts, quality of content, and relevancy for Amazon, among other things.
The idea with the program is to allow Amazon to better tap into social media’s power to drive sales. Today’s influencers regularly promote products they like in their online postings, including YouTube videos – often either as part of a brand relationship or as a means of generating income through affiliate sales. Amazon wants to now insert itself more directly into that action.
An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the program’s further opening in a statement to TechCrunch:
“We recently enabled a self-service tool for YouTube influencers only to be able to sign up for the Amazon Influencer program,” they said.

The new tool is aimed specifically at YouTubers who want to have their channel vetted by Amazon. After clicking “Get Started,” applicants are walked a few steps where they have to verify their social identity and eligibility. The tool states that a YouTube account is required to join, but other ways to qualify will be added in the future.
The program also has a refreshed website with a more polished look alongside some basic details on how the program works.

According to the website, Amazon Influencers will get their own customizable page on Amazon, including a vanity URL they can share where their product recommendations are featured. When customers shop their page, the influencer will earn a commission on qualifying purchases.
The page explains, too, that the program is an expansion of the online Amazon Associates program for social media influencers, as it’s offering a new way to direct traffic to Amazon to boost sales.
Early program participants include popular YouTube channel What’s Up Moms, Mark Cuban, and Felicia Day, according to the Influencer homepage. (Amazon will not disclose how many beta participants the program has signed up to date.)

As it falls under the Amazon Affiliate Program, the Influencer Program is not necessarily offering higher commissions – it’s simply making it easier to send customers to Amazon to shop the product recommendations.
Key to this program is that vanity URL, which is meant to be something short and memorable.
Amazon notes it’s “especially useful when promoted verbally or in an environment where linking is not possible.” In other words, it could easily be mentioned in a YouTube video while the product being promoted is discussed.
This is not the first time Amazon has tried to use video to drive sales. It had launched its own watch-and-shop online show called “Style Code” last year, but it didn’t pan out. The show was canceled in May. However, with the Influencer Program, Amazon can effectively turn YouTube stars into sellers, also much like a modern-day HSN or QVC.
While the debut of the self-serve tool seems to imply the program has now fully launched, we understand that’s not the case. The program is still considered to be in “beta” for the vast majority of people trying to sign up, as their applications will be vetted manually by Amazon staff.
Amazon also intends this program to extend beyond YouTube. The retailer aims to offer support to influencers across all major social networks, which should include the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
It’s unclear how this program may tie into Amazon Spark, the retailer’s recently launched Instagram-like service, however. On Spark, Prime members can post photos of products they like and other ideas for all to see. Presumably, influencers could post their URL there as well, as the link can be shared anywhere on the web.
The Influencer Program is still something of an experiment for the time being, and may change in the future as Amazon broadens access.",2017-08-24,1530966,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/amazon-influencer.jpg?w=738,social/,"social-media,e-commerce",Amazon’s social media ‘Influencers’ program opens up to YouTube stars,"youtube,amazon",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/amazons-social-media-influencers-program-opens-up-to-youtube-stars/
Lucas Matney,Personnel,"Veteran Facebook exec Andrew “Boz” Bosworth is taking over consumer hardware efforts at the company, including projects under groups like Building 8 and Oculus. The announcement was made internally by Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, Business Insider reports.
A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the appointment to TechCrunch.
Bosworth, who joined Facebook in January of 2006, has been instrumental to a number of core product features, including perhaps most notably, the News Feed. He has most recently served as the company’s VP of ads and business platform.
Long-time Facebook ads engineering head Mark Rabkin will be taking over Bosworth’s ad responsibilities as he shifts to hardware.
This move comes following a number of leaks which have detailed some of the efforts being made to move the internet company into consumer hardware products, including a video chat device and a dedicated smart speaker.
The new report sheds some light on the video chat device specifically, codenamed “Aloha,” which will reportedly feature a large touch screen and function similarly to Amazon’s Echo Show. The device may use facial detection to recognize people participating in video calls and will reportedly cost around $499, though pricing has not been finalized. The company may also be working on its own consumer 360-degree camera as well as a “necklace embedded with sensors,” according to the report. Oculus, which sells virtual reality hardware and is currently working on augmented reality products, will also be under Bosworth’s jurisdiction.
“We are excited about our long-term investments in virtual reality, augmented reality, and consumer hardware,” a company spokesperson said in a statement given to TechCrunch. “We believe these new technologies have the potential to bring the world closer together in entirely new ways, and we’ve built great teams with strong leadership in each of these areas. Bringing these teams closer together will help us move even faster as we continue to invest in our 10-year roadmap.”

Katie Roof,Social,"Remember Valerie Plame Wilson?
The former CIA agent, who got involved in what became known as the “Plame Affair,” has a solution for ridding Twitter of America’s favorite troll.
Wilson launched a fundraiser last week to buy the social media service, tweeting:
So far, Wilson has raised just $12,000 of the $1 billion she’s seeking. 
It’s unclear whether Wilson is doing this to pressure Twitter to block Trump or if she actually believes her mission will pan out. Twitter, of course, would cost much more than $1 billion. (Its market cap is about $12 billion right now.) But Wilson says that if she owned a significant stake, it would put pressure on the company.
“If we can’t get a majority interest, we’ll explore options for buying a significant stake in the company and champion this proposal at the annual shareholder meeting,” Wilson writes on her GoFundMe page. “If that’s impossible for any reason or if there is a surplus from this campaign, 100% of the balance of proceeds will be donated to Global Zero, a nonprofit organization leading the resistance to nuclear war.”
Wilson’s complaints about President Trump’s use of Twitter are not uncommon, but CEO Jack Dorsey has said that Trump’s tweets that suggested violence toward journalists didn’t break the rules.
Wilson says it’s the threat of nuclear war with North Korea that “takes it to a dangerous new level.”
White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders disagrees, unsurprisingly.
In an emailed statement sent to news outlets earlier today, Sanders called Wilson’s endeavor  “ridiculous,” and suggested the shortage of funding for Wilson’s idea underscores that Americans are satisfied with Trump’s Twitter use.",2017-08-23,1530601,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-836314276.jpg?w=738,social/,valerie-plame,Former CIA agent hopes to buy Twitter to kick Trump off,twitter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/former-cia-agent-hopes-to-buy-twitter-to-kick-trump-off/
Darrell Etherington,Apps,"Facebook has been a big supporter of 360-degree photos and video, adding support for the immersive media formats early on Facebook itself. Now, the social tech company is adding support for capturing 360-degree photos right within the Facebook app itself.
The 360 photo capability is rolling out across both iOS and Android starting today, and includes the ability to zoom and tag friends. It’s also now possible to use 360-degree images (from any source) as Cover Photos. This is the first ever update to format support Facebook has made for Cover Photos since its introduction.
360 photos otherwise behave as regular pictures on Facebook, meaning you can post them to your Timeline, share them in albums alongside other standard images, and add them to groups. Capturing using the Facebook camera is designed to be as easy as possible, too, with Facebook employing computer vision to automatically stitch the photo after you rotate your phone to capture it panorama-style.

Natasha Lomas,Europe,"Two legal judgements at the highest level in Europe in recent years have reaffirmed that all Member States’ data retention regimes must comply with core principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality in order to avoid breaching citizens’ fundamental rights. However a new report surveying the current status of legislation pertaining to the retention of communications data across the region has found that many of the EU’s 28 members are not adhering to what privacy rights advocacy organization Privacy International describes as the “basic standard”.
It’s urging all EU Member States to review their national legislation and amend it where necessary to come into compliance, while also recommending that telcos and other companies subject to data retention obligations should challenge existing non-compliant data retention regimes.
The two recent CJEU judgements of note here are the Digital Rights Ireland case (2014), and the Tele-2/ Watson decision (2016). The former judgement rolled back an earlier EU directive aimed at harmonizing data retention regimes across the bloc by asking Member States to impose obligations on providers of comms services to retain certain types of data for a period of between six months and two years. While the latter expanded on the earlier jurisprudence.
In the Digital Rights Ireland decision the CJEU held the 2006 directive to be invalid as a disproportionate exercise of the EU legislature’s powers and in breach of citizen’s human rights.
The court was concerned about the lack of satisfactory limits to access, and by the fact data retention periods were not tailored to the goals or crimes concerned.
In the more recent Tele-2/Watson decision, at the end of last year, the court expanded on Digital Rights Ireland, with a judgment which positively asserted minimum safeguards of EU law that must be prescribed in any national data retention legislation — specifically precluding:
However Privacy International’s survey of Member States data retention regimes indicates that many are yet to make the necessary changes to ensure domestic legislation is compliant with the court rulings.
It’s urging the European Commission to provide guidance on reviewing national data retention laws to help ensure states’ conformity with fundamental rights, as interpreted by Europe’s top court, the CJEU.
“Member States have an obligation to ensure that their laws comply with the CJEU’s jurisprudence, and EU law more generally. It is thus concerning to notice that only a limited proportion of Member States have actually annulled their pre-Digital Rights legislation and that practically no Member States’ laws currently comply with Tele-2/Watson,” it writes in the report.
“Very few governments have taken the lead in pushing legal reforms, and to the extent that limited positive changes at the national level have occurred, they have been the result of litigation initiated by NGOs and other small interest groups.”
Privacy International found that close to half (40 per cent) of the countries surveyed for the report still had the invalidated 2006 directive in place. While, as a generally rule, it said it found that where repeals or amendments had taken place this was as a result of challenges in national courts predominantly by human rights NGOs — with governments and legislators “largely inactive”.
And even in Member States where the prior data retention regime has been invalidated in the national courts, and where new data retention legislation has come into force after Digital Rights Ireland, it found national laws to be “nonetheless inconsistent” with the CJEU’s most recent ruling in Tele-2/Watson — saying this was true for around a fifth of the countries surveyed.
“In those countries the regimes might allow indiscriminate retention of data in bulk or provide vague and ill-defined regulation on access to that data by relevant authorities,” it warns.
“Data retention legislation is being considered or is on hold in about 30% of the jurisdictions surveyed, and in about half of these cases attempts to ensure compliance with Tele-2/Watson are being pushed. Nonetheless, we are now eight months into the CJEU decision, and the slow pace by which changes are evolving in these jurisdictions is concerning, given how impactful these data retention regimes are on Europeans’ fundamental rights and freedoms,” it adds.
Privacy International’s report was compiled after consulting with digital rights NGOs and industry in 21 national jurisdictions across the EU — specifically in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
In the UK’s case, the government passed expanded state surveillance legislation at the end of last year — aka the Investigatory Powers Act (or, to give it its colloquial name, the ‘Snoopers’ charter‘) — which includes a provision requiring that ISPs retain web activity data for all their users for a period of 12 months.
Asked what it has been able to glean regarding the UK government’s intention to respond to the Tele-2/Watson ruling, a Privacy International spokeswoman noted that the case has been remitted back to the court of appeal — saying there’s therefore still no clarity on how the legislation might be amended.
“The government stated recently that “…in light of the CJEU judgement, and in order to bring an end to the litigation, the government have accepted to the Court of Appeal that the Act was inconsistent with EU law in two areas.” However, until a hearing takes place, the details of what the government is prepared to accept, the response to this from the Claimants’ and ultimately what results from the CJEU’s ruling is unknown,” she told us.
The spokeswoman also said it’s unclear whether the data retention obligations the law places on ISPs have been activated yet, or whether they’re on pause as a result of the ongoing legal uncertainty. “It is unclear whether this is current in force,” she said, adding: “Not all of the Investigatory Powers Act has come into force.”
There’s a further uncertainty in the UK’s case relating to the Brexit referendum decision for the country to leave the European Union.
Since that vote last year, the government has said it wants to extract the UK from the jurisdiction of the CJEU — raising questions of whether it might seek to avoid compliance with the EU-level data retention rules once it’s no longer a Member State.
However the Privacy International spokeswoman suggested any such move by the UK to ignore Europe-wide principles on data retention could complicate the government’s stated aim for “a quick and seamless data flow with the EU following Brexit” — an essential component if UK digital businesses are to continue to serve customers in the EU after the two-year Brexit negotiation process comes to an end in May 2019.
“Failing to comply with this judgement will raise questions as to whether the UK law provides equivalent protection to personal data as the EU standards,” she suggested. “Further, the government’s recent position paper on Brexit raises more questions than it answers in relation to the CJEU and the bearing its rulings will have on the UK.”",2017-09-06,1536723,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/368912557_2fc44d3709_b.jpg?w=738,europe/,"national-security,law,data-retention,mass-surveillance","EU states’ data retention laws still violating privacy rights, report warns",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/eu-states-data-retention-laws-still-violating-privacy-rights-report-warns/
Natasha Lomas,Augmented Reality,"Ed tech startup Labster whose software platform enables virtual simulations of laboratories for teaching life science to students, has closed a $10 million Series A round of funding led by early stage European VC firm Balderton Capital. Stockholm-based Northzone is also joining the round, as is Unity Technologies founder David Helgason — clearly spying strategic potential in a platform that makes use of 3D gaming environments for an educational purpose.
Labster launched its lab simulation software back in 2013, after founding the business in 2011 and initially working on the concept in stealth. It has created around 65 simulations thus far, covering life science study topics — from a basic introduction to acids and bases where students perform a simulation of handling corrosive chemicals and get to see the consequences of not following good lab safety protocol, to a simulation of using a confocal microscope (a piece of lab kit that can run to multiple thousands of dollars in its physical form).
All the 3D simulations include games and challenges designed to keep students engaged and learning — such as murder mystery puzzles and multiple choice quiz questions, with text theory also available for students’ reference. The 3D environments are designed much like point and click adventure games, meaning lab equipment can be interacted with and environments navigated by clicking around.

The startup’s grand vision is to replace the role of textbooks for science education up to graduate level with a more interactive learning experience enabled by virtual simulations of lab equipment and experiments — so a scalable and accessible gamification of the learning experience, which does not require an institution to shell out on expensive, real-world lab equipment in order for its students to learn.
Still, CEO and co-founder Mads Bonde concedes universities aren’t the faster adopters of new technologies, so he describes the learning “status quo” — i.e. textbooks and lectures — as Labster’s main competitor at this point.
“We know the way that the education space is moving it’s not going to happen overnight, but even the university sector publishers know that that’s the way that things are going — that the next version of what is now called the text book will be much more interactive,” he tells TechCrunch. “In the medium term it definitely needs to co-exist with a lot of other methods — including books, including videos, including other areas.”
When we last spoke to Labster, in 2013 for the launch of its product, it had raised $1M in grants and non-equity support at that point. Bonde tells us now it has since topped up that to a further ~$10M — which is in addition to the now closed $10M Series A VC investment.
“We’ve been in dialogue with a lot of investors over the years but have chosen to focus on a combination of things, so bootstrapping but especially sales early on combined with grants from especially the government here in Europe and in Denmark,” he says. “That has funded our collaborations with universities… which is kind of like the hidden way that we’ve gotten to where we are today.”
He says the reason Labster is taking VC funding now is as a result of being approached by an undisclosed strategic investor who was keen to collaborate — which pushed it to take a closer look at the options of either continuing to grow organically vs taking VC cash and putting their foot on the gas to accelerate product development and expansion in multiple markets.
“We ended up concluding that VC funding was the right thing for us to do at this stage because we had scaled our product and now really need to fuel sales, marketing and getting our product across globally — so that fueled the decision there,” says Bonde, confirming this particular strategic investor was not Unity’s Helgason.
Labster’s general calculus is that, ultimately, it will cost the same to develop 3D educational content via its platform as it costs to create content for a textbook. Although Bonde concedes there’s still “a huge imbalance” in the cost. But one way it’s trying to shrink that differential more quickly is via a content builder system it’s created atop its simulation platform — enabling users to build out its content proposition.
Some of Labster’s Series A funding will be going towards this “lab builder” system — which lets educators and individuals create bespoke simulator content for other students to learn.
The majority of content currently available on the platform has been developed by Labster working with educational institute customers — including some high profile institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US and Imperial College in London — but that presents an obvious speed bump to scaling the business so you can see why they’re looking for ways to widen the content creation pipe.
“We have students who have done this as well,” notes Bonde of lab builder created content. “That’s also our long term vision to revolutionize the way that science is taught by anyone being able to create high class 3D simulations like games and deploy them through our platform.”
“If you hit a core part of the curriculum, each simulation should last for a very long time,” adds Balderton’s Sam Myer, who heads up the Nordics region for the investment firm, on the content pricing point — noting also that Labster’s simulations can be reused “over and over”.
“The cost actually isn’t that different,” he argues.

Myer says Labster’s proposition stood out for the VC firm on account of it being “at the center of the education market as a whole going digital”, and for the way it’s “rethinking what you can do when you have digital platforms to build on”. — i.e. rather than trying to bring existing formats online; be that textbooks (to ebooks) or lectures (online streams) or indeed whole courses (MOOCs).
“Labster is really rethinking what educational content should look like when you can design it from the ground up using these new tools,” he tells TechCrunch. “So it’s a very different approach to ed tech that many other companies have.”
Currently Labster has around 150 institutions globally using its platform, with the UK and the US as its primary markets. (Bonde also flags users in Asian markets, including in Hong Kong, Singapore, and in South America.)
It has a blended business model, where it sells b2b to universities and educational institutions as well as b2c to students who might want to make individual use of its tools to aid their learning — and it’s intended to invest to expand on both fronts with the new funding.
Expanding simulation content across more science topics is also on the roadmap for the next 12 months. Plus, it will be expanding sales and marketing efforts, especially targeting universities in the US and the UK, with Bonde noting “heavy investment” there” — including growing the headcount of the team.
“Over the last five years we’ve really focused on developing this platform which can handle educational simulations but with the game engine built on top of Unity so it’s possible to design learning experiences where you can learn the way that we believe humans are supposed to learn,” he argues. “The way that children learn as well — which is through interacting, through talking with different people, through experiencing the way the world is. And the you internalize that and learn from that.”
And while guided simulations might at least suggest the potential for an even wider disruption of traditional teaching institutions, say by removing the need for such institutions to exist at all, Bonde says there’s still a key role for universities to play — in hosting content and ensuring quality is up to a benchmarked educational standard.
Myer agrees. “I think universities are always going to be important in terms of guiding what should be taught, and how these simulations should be designed — and so it’s always going to be important to partner with some of the universities that [Labster is] already doing work with,” he says. “The leaders in this space… And then each university’s main differentiation, their main brand is what they teach — and how good their education is, and their sort of stamp of approval. So each university will want to have a say in what gets taught. So I think they’ll always be important.”
Another component of Labster’s vision is VR and AR. Virtual reality and augmented reality are areas of special interest for the startup, although — pragmatically and some might say realistically — it’s not built its platform to be reliant on these technologies. Rather it’s taking a cross-platform approach, meaning users of laptops and tablets can make use of the platform so there’s no requirement for any dedicated headset hardware. This allows it to address the current reality of the kit students and universities own, even as it contemplates transformational VR-enabled learning environments becoming a mass market future reality.

Bonde is certainly convinced that immersive VR simulations will play a leading role in the future of education, noting for example that the technology is developing to support feedback via additional peripherals such as tactile gloves. He also believes augmented reality will play a key bridging role — helping students who have cut their undergraduate teeth learning in entirely virtual 3D labs to transition to using real-world lab equipment for post-grad learning (where purely 3D simulations would not suffice).
But his conviction is tempered with patience that such changes will only come over the longer term. “We believe that in the long term virtual reality and AR as well will be one of the  main ways to learn. But it’s not going to happen overnight,” he suggests. “So what we’ve done is to create a platform where it’s possible to use it on a computer and on VR with the same code-base and the same simulation basically. So the students can choose which device. And they can even switch between devices — both VR and non-VR.”
“Right now VR is not crucial for our proposition,” he adds. “With laptops etc we get the big leap forward… The way that you interact in a game-like environment — that’s really where you get the major benefit.”
Balderton’s Myer is also cool on VR in the near to medium term. “VR, down the line, I think will be the best way to display what they can do,” he says of Labster’s lab simulations. “Labster’s really about learning by doing. And they have these very strong 3D simulations. Right now the [VR] hardware — the actual devices — aren’t available to most universities or companies or schools that want to be using it. And so it’s important to be able to do these 3D simulations on your mobile phone, or on your laptop or whatever you might be using.
“But they’re building it to have this very rich 3D environment that can be translated to VR. So I think VR is going to change the way that education happens in a pretty big way… There’s a lot of research around simulations and how they really improve learning outcomes. And then VR is a really good format for these simulations.”
Asked how bullish he is about VR generally, Myer suggests the tech still has a long road ahead of it to achieve mainstream adoption — though he sees nearer term applications for education use-cases vs gaming. “I think it’s going to take a while before we see the mass market. Especially when we talk about things like casual gaming — it’s going to take a while,” he argues.
“I’ve spent quite a lot of time looking at gaming as well, where VR is seen as one of the platform they’re trying to build for. And actually the use-case for education at the moment is much stronger than gaming. If you think of what you do when you’re trying to learn in general is you pick up a textbook or whatever and you try to submerge yourself into this body of content for a long period of time. And so VR, given that it’s a very submersive experience, is actually very challenging to do for gaming where you’re sort of dipping in and out… It’s actually very difficult to build a game that works well for VR at this stage.”
In developing its learning platform, Bonde says Labster has worked with psychologists to try identify educational advantages that can be enabled by technology, such as tracking users’ emotions and blood pressure and analyzing brain scans during use of the platform — and based on what it’s seen from this research he claims VR advances the learning experience because users are “totally immersed”.
But he simultaneously emphasizes Labster’s tech agnosticism, adding: “It’s important for us not to be reliant on virtual reality propagation for our success.”",2017-09-06,1535711,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lab-without-text.jpg?w=738,europe/,"unity,simulation,balderton-capital,labster",Virtual science lab startup Labster bags $10M to accelerate its ed tech play,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/virtual-science-lab-startup-labster-bags-10m/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs to show off their mixing skills, has been acquired by BandLab Technologies, the Singapore-based ‘social’ music-making platform. Terms of the deal are undisclosed, though it was widely known that Chew.tv, which has been described as ‘Twitch for DJs,’ had been struggling financially over the last six months.
Originally a graduate of accelerator Ignite, Chew.tv launched in 2015 as an online community for aspiring and professional DJs, with an emphasis on live video. The premise being that dance music DJs are both content consumers and creators, and that Chew.tv could serve both needs, allowing DJs at different levels to learn from and be inspired by each other — not entirely dissimilar to online gamers.
That appeared to find some traction, seeing Chew garner an undoubtedly loyal and passionate user base. In July, it disclosed that the service had a community of 380,000+ users, who, since launch, have collectively created over 120,000 hours of content.
With that said, Chew.tv narrowly avoided the deadpool earlier this year after its streaming infrastructure was “heavily misused” by a nefarious hacker the previous December. “The abuse cost is more than we can afford, and the combined total of that and our regular running costs is enough to put us out of business,” the company emailed users in March.
However, in a nice turn of events, Chew’s community rallied together under the #savedchew hashtag, and via £12,000 in donations and an increase in premium subscriptions, the service was saved and the startup, which was down to a single staff member in co-founder Will Benton, lived to fight another day. Which brings us to today’s acquisition.
I’m told that BandLab has acquired all technology & IP of the Chew platform. “We’re not disclosing dollar amounts for the deal. This was a privately funded deal – we worked to find a fair price that both parties were happy with,” says a BandLab spokesperson.
Meanwhile, BandLab​ ​Technologies says Chew.tv will be rebranded as “Chew by BandLab”. In addition, the startup’s live streaming technology will be integrated into BandLab’s web platform, Android and iOS apps “for use by BandLab’s existing user base of close to 2 million users”.
“I am very pleased that Chew will now be supported by the BandLab team. For the past two years I’ve been closely watching the growth and development of this great platform and community of DJs,” said Meng Ru Kuok, BandLab CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “One of the most important parts of being a musician today is performing live, and as an extension of that, it’s extremely important for us to be able to digitally support creators and musicians who want to bring their live performances to the world”.",2017-09-06,1535994,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/image-bandlab-welcomes-chew-to-the-family.jpg?w=738,europe/,"bandlab-technologies,chew","BandLab​ ​Technologies​ acquires Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/bandlab%e2%80%8b-%e2%80%8btechnologies%e2%80%8b-acquires-chew-tv/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"The race is on for autonomous vehicle technology, and now a startup out of the U.K. is the latest to throw its hat into the ring to help build it. Cambridge-based FiveAI — a partner in the U.K.’s StreetWise self-driving project — has raised £14 million ($18 million) and £12.8 million ($17 million) in two tranches to fill out its plans for a two-part business in the world of self-driving services. First, FiveAI is building its own autonomous driving system; and second, FiveAI will use that AI-based platform to take on Uber and other transportation services with a fleet of self-driving taxis.
Lakestar Capital — the firm founded by prolific (and successful) investor Klaus Hommels — led this Series A round, with Amadeus Capital Partners, Notion Capital and Kindred (which all previously invested in its seed round of $2.7 million) also participating.
On top of the Series A, FiveAI will also get a boost in the form of a grant from the U.K. government: it has so far received £12.8 million ($17 million) for StreetWise, a project it’s working on with Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, Oxford University, insurer Direct Line and others to develop a self-driving car pilot for London to cut traffic congestion and free up parking spaces. StreetWise is slated for its first test runs at the end of 2019.
There are many, many companies today working on autonomous car systems. They include other startups like Zoox and Nutonomy (which, like FiveAI, are building platforms that they plan to use in their own fleets), transportation providers like Uber, car makers (which themselves are acquiring startup talent to kickstart their efforts), those like Bosch that build in-car systems already and, of course, tech giants like Google, Apple and Baidu that approach cars like the next big hardware challenge.
With the billions in funding and armies of engineers that these companies have to commit to these efforts, FiveAI’s Series A and government grant appear very modest indeed.
But Stan Boland — FiveAI’s CEO and co-founder — is not one to be deterred. In an interview earlier today in FiveAI’s (still sparse) new offices, he made a case for why Europe needs its own startup in this area. For one, our driving culture is completely different and our cities don’t look like cities in the U.S. or Asia. And further, he argues that it’s high time that we see more moonshots coming from here, building on the region’s strength in artificial intelligence.
“We think it’s time that Europe builds a big tech company,” he said, noting that transport could well be at the heart of that big tech company. “Transport is a sector that is ready for change.”
It so happens that Boland is probably one founder investors will listen to when he explains a big plan. He has been at the head of some of Europe’s biggest startup exits in the last several years: they include Element 14, a spin-out from ARM that was acquired by Broadcom for $640 million; Icera, acquired by Nvidia for $367 million; and IoT startup Neul, acquired by Huawei, before moving on to FiveAI with other co-founders Ben Peters, Steve Allpress, John Redford and Simon Walker.
“If anything, the bolder you are with investors, the more they seem to want to give you,” he said. (This may be a consequence of the aforementioned track record. I’m fairly certain that if, say, I walked into Klaus Hommels’ office and described my vision for an autonomous car startup, I might get quietly escorted out of the room.)
“FiveAI is a fantastic example where the U.K. has the talent, ambition and market to build a truly successful technology-led company. Dense European cities present totally different technical, behavioral, regulatory and infrastructure challenges to their U.S. and Chinese counterparts for safe urban driverless technologies,” said Lakestar Capital’s Dharmash Mistry, who is joining FiveAI’s board with this round. “By assembling its talented team in the U.K. and seeking to support London’s transport objectives in partnership with the city itself, FiveAI can play a vital role in reducing congestion, emissions, costs, accidents and journey times, boosting the city economy at the same time.”
To be clear, he also added that FiveAI has raised exactly as much as it wanted to, for now, and he also said that he has also put some of his own money into the operation, as well.
To date, FiveAI has yet to launch any products, and if you have been following the autonomous car space you know there are many pieces that will need to come together before FiveAI, or any other company, can hope for large deployments.
Boland describes FiveAI today as in “Phase One” of its business plan: it is building an autonomous platform to run vehicles, which will include demonstrating the platform’s cognitive abilities and running pilots. Phase Two will include the development of a dispatch system, the user experience development and the first commercial launch. It will also involve much more work to improve the regulatory environment “to make it feasible.” He believes this will come in 2021.
Phase Three will be FiveAI’s big push to scale in the market. “It’s at that point that we will need to buy lots of cars,” where FiveAI’s autonomous system will be loaded, he said. “It’s probably at that point that we’ll need to raise a significant amount of money, in the hundreds of millions or billions.”
As for a Plan B, there is no Plan B that Boland will consider today.
“We do recognize that startups do pivot, but we are not running multiple contingency plans right now,” he said. 
“It may sound completely mad to some,” he said, “but the reason why we think it’s needed and will work is because personal mobility is not going to be a winner takes all market. There is no single solution that will work everywhere. We can change public transport.”

To promote the launch, Londoners are being offered a 50% discount on fares until the end of September, alongside suspended surge pricing. That may spark a price war with Uber, but Uber is much bigger and better known, having 40,000 drivers and 3 million London users. Taxify also only in 25 cities globally compared to Uber’s 600.
What Taxify does have is a lower cost business model, allowing passengers to pay cheaper fares and also letting drivers retain more of the profits. Taxify takes a 15 per cent commission on rides compared to the 20-25 percent Uber charges drivers. It also accepts cash as well electronic payments from riders, unlike Uber. Taxify allows drivers to create a defined radius for pick ups, meaning they don’t need to stray too far from home, which may well appeal to some drivers.
The startup has built what it calls an “all-in-one solution for taxi companies”. Basically it’s a booking system with a consumer-facing app.
Traditional taxi companies use Taxify’s web-based dispatcher and fleet management systems to manage their back-end and unite under Taxify’s consumer facing app to stay competitive against expanding networks like Hailo and Uber. That then lowers Taxify’s costs, allowing them to charge less.
Taxify’s platform replaces the expensive platforms offered by older firms, allowing taxi firms to automate their workflows and start getting orders via the Taxify app at a fraction of the cost of custom solutions. It then charges the cab firm a low monthly fee of about 12-15€ per driver per month.
Taxify’s other focus is its rapidly growing Local Partner programme, which allows entrepreneurs to set up their local Taxify business using a franchise model and become a city manager on a revenue share model.
The startup claims to have over 2.5 million customers, and recently announced a strategic partnership with Didi Chuxing in China.
Markus Villig, founder and CEO of Taxify, said: “London is a huge and thriving marketplace for private urban transport, and we’re excited to launch here.”
Taxify originally emerged in 2014 with a seed round which was funded by investors from the so-called “Skype Mafia” in Estonia.
The launch comes as Uber struggles with legal setbacks, workplace harassment scandals, driver protests, the firing of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick and bitter disputes amongst its board. Last week it named Expedia Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to lead the company.",2017-09-05,1536157,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/taxify.jpg?w=738,europe/,taxify,"Taxify launches in London, acquiring a cab firm to scale and discounting prices",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/taxify-launches-in-london-acquiring-a-cab-firm-to-scale-and-discounting-prices/
Natasha Lomas,Europe,"In a landmark judgement concerning privacy in the workplace, the grand chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that companies must give employees prior warning if they are monitoring their electronic communications.
The ruling could have repercussions for how companies can monitor European employees’ communications in the workplace, with the need for checks and balances on any monitoring to ensure there are sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse.
The judgement pertains to a case dating back ten years which was brought by Romanian national, Bogdan Bărbulescu, who in 2007 was fired by his employer for breaching internal regulations over use of company resources for personal purposes.
Specifically, he had used an instant messenger tool to exchange personal messages with his fianceé and brother. Transcripts of the communications were subsequently presented to him by his employer as evidence for terminating his employment for breach of the company’s internal regulations.
The grand chamber has ruled that Bărbulescu’s employer violated his right to respect for one’s “private and family life, his home and his correspondence” — aka Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
Earlier Romanian courts had rejected his complaint that his employer had violated his right to correspondence — including in January 2016, when a chamber judgement of the ECHR had held by six votes to one that there had been no violation of Article 8. However the grand chamber has held, by 11 votes to six, that Bărbulescu’s right to a private life was violated.
In a press release about the decision, the court noted that while it was questionable whether the complainant could have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in view of his employer’s restrictive regulations on Internet use (of which he had been informed), it judged that an employer’s instructions “could not reduce private social life in the workplace to zero”.
“The right to respect for private life and for the privacy of correspondence continued to exist, even if these might be restricted in so far as necessary,” it writes.
The crux of the decision rests on Bărbulescu’s employer having failed to adequately inform him in advance that it might be monitoring his communications. The intrusiveness of the monitoring — with email contents being read — was also weighed by the judges in making this ruling.
“The Court considered, following international and European standards, that to qualify as prior notice, the warning from an employer had to be given before the monitoring was initiated, especially where it entailed accessing the contents of employees’ communications,” it writes. “The Court concluded, from the material in the case file, that Mr Bărbulescu had not been informed in advance of the extent and nature of his employer’s monitoring, or the possibility that the employer might have access to the actual contents of his messages.”
The grand chamber also ruled that national courts had failed to sufficiently assess the scope and degree of the privacy intrusion (which involved monitoring all the contents of Bărbulescu’s communications); whether less intrusive methods could have been used; whether there had been legitimate reasons to justify the monitoring; and judged that national courts had not considered the seriousness of the consequences of the monitoring — i.e. Bărbulescu’s subsequent dismissal.
In the judgement, the grand chamber specifies several criteria to be used by national authorities when assessing whether monitoring of workplace communications is proportionate and employees are protected against arbitrariness, including —",2017-09-05,1535966,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/6092000030_b8808e63f4_b.jpg?w=738,europe/,"privacy,law",European court rules employees must be warned if comms are monitored,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/european-court-rules-employees-must-be-warned-if-comms-are-monitored/

Neil Rimer, founding partner
Neil co-founded Index Ventures in Geneva in 1996.
His vision was to support the most ambitious entrepreneurs, bringing Silicon Valley-style investing to Europe at a time when “venture capital” was still a new term outside the US. As he recalled in a Financial Times interview: “We started every meeting with a slide that was literally ‘What is VC?’”
20 years on, while staying true to its European roots, Index has become one of the world’s leading venture capital firms, with principal offices in London and San Francisco. So far, the firm has raised $5.6 billion and has more than 160 companies in its portfolio.
Today, Neil works with entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic, among them the founders of Deliveroo, Funding Circle, Roblox and Typeform. He previously led Index investments in companies including Betfair, Climate, Supercell and Trello.
Born in Montreal, Neil graduated in History and Economics at Stanford, and gained an MBA from Harvard Business School. He spent four years with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, and joined Index Securities in 1990 – the predecessor to Index Ventures. Neil is also on the board of the non-profit, non-governmental organization, Human Rights Watch.
In his FT interview, Neil summed up his approach to investment. “We all exercise our brains as cynics every day, we’re all experts in what happens when things go wrong. But for me, the more valuable exercise is: What happens if it does work?”

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Aifloo, a Swedish startup that combines hardware sensors and AI to offer a ‘smart wristband’ to help care for the elderly, has raised €5.1 million in new funding.
The Series A round is led by EQT Ventures, with the VC firm’s Analytics Partner, Henrik Landgren, citing the team and technology as reasons to invest, noting that the e-health company is marrying “vast amounts of data and modern AI” to help elderly people remain living independently for longer.
Founded by Felix Etzler, Michael Collaros and Anders Widgren in 2015, Aifloo is described as an e-health system designed to improve the quality of life for the elderly and provide peace of mind for relatives and caregivers.
The hardware is a wristband packed full of sensors and the AI monitors the wearer’s behaviour so as to alert caregivers of any potentials issues. These are cited as things like trips or falls, alterations in eating habits, and changes in sleep behaviour.
“Aifloo is a completely new e-health system that continually learns about an individual’s behavior – detecting if something is wrong,” explains Etzler. “We help seniors to keep going strong, give peace of mind to family and friends and augment the care delivered by professional caregivers”.
The idea, says the Aifloo founder, is to “digitalize detection of human behaviour in a non-intrusive way”. Specifically, the Aifloo wristband is conceived as a discreet wearable with a long battery life, whilst the real-time cloud AI-analysis does the heavy lifting.
“The service measures trends over time, detects emergencies and alerts people of a problem even if you’re unable to,” he says. “We hope to help carers deliver the right care, at the right time, to those who need it the most, with a little help from technology”.
That, argues Etzler, is very different to the status quo in which the systems used in care are outdated. “A lot of resource goes into manual surveillance,” he says, while more modern solutions are “expensive, not customisable to the individual, or complicated”.
“On the other hand, wearables are targeting the young and healthy or focused on one medical condition, such as diabetes. We’ve created an individualized, durable, easy to use, long-lived solution to a complex problem and packaged it in a nice, wearer friendly product and service”.
To that end, an early customer of Aifloo is Aleris, one of the leading healthcare companies in Scandinavia. Etzler says the next step is begin marketing the service to in-home care companies.",2017-09-05,1535299,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/aifloobandmancoffee-high-1.jpg?w=738,europe/,eqt-ventures,"Aifloo, a Swedish startup that sells a ‘smart wristband’ to help care for the elderly, raises €5.1M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/aifloo/
