Steve O'Hear,Europe,"VizEat, the European “social eating platform” that connects travellers and local hosts around authentic food experiences — such as dining in a local’s home, cooking classes, and food tours — has acquired EatWith, a similar startup headquartered in San Francisco.
Terms of the deal are undisclosed. EatWith is thought to have raised over $8 million from backers such as Greylock Partners, which led the company’s Series A round in late 2014.
“As a policy, we don’t disclose deal terms,” a spokesperson for VizEat tells me. “VizEat will be acquiring EatWith.com as an entire entity (including website and current ongoing activity) to expand its global offering of immersive food experiences with locals. EatWith hosts will also be given access to the wider offering for the group’s global partners with the tourism and travel industry, both online and traditional”.
Furthermore, I understand that EatWith’s founders had already left the startup, but that key team members of the EatWith team in San Francisco and Tel-Aviv are joining the combined entity. “They will manage and expand the host community and the partnerships. More hires will be done in the coming months,” says VizEat. In addition, EatWith will continue its existing partnership with TripAdvisor, which CrunchBase also lists as a backer.
Meanwhile, VizEat says the acquisition of EatWith makes it the leader for enabling social eating experiences with locals and puts the startup at the forefront of the sharing economy within the food and travel sectors. It claims more than 25,000 hosts across 130 countries, with localised versions of its app available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Chinese.
The roll up of EatWith follows a similar acquisition in 2015 when the company gobbled up Paris-based Cookening, an early pioneer in the dine with a local space.",2017-09-07,1536120,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/cracc83c2a9dit-karma-spies.jpg?w=738,startups/,"eatwith,vizeat",European ‘social eating platform’ VizEat acquires U.S.-based EatWith,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/vizeat-swallows-eatwith/
Catherine Shu,Fundings & Exits,"Five months after abandoning its proposed purchase of Monsanto’s precision planting subsidiary due to anti-trust concerns, agricultural equipment giant Deere and Company announced that it will spend $305 million to acquire ag-tech startup Blue River Technology. Founded in 2011 and based in Sunnyvale, Blue River develops machine learning technology for precision farming and counts Monsanto’s venture capital arm, Monsanto Growth Ventures, among its investors.
According to Crunchbase, Blue River raised a total of $30.35 million in funding and its other backers included Data Collective, Pontifax AgTech, Innovation Endeavors and Khosla Ventures.
Precision agriculture refers to farming practices that rely on computer vision, machine learning and smart devices to improve yield. It’s attractive to growers because it automates labor-intensive parts of the farming process, allowing them to cut labor costs, and also reduces the waste of pesticides, water and fertilizer.
Precision farming is an important part of Deere’s growth strategy and it agreed to buy Precision Planting LLC from Monsanto in November 2015, but gave up on the deal in May after the U.S. Department of Justice filed an anti-trust lawsuit. The Department of Justice claimed that the deal would have been worth about $190 million and that Deere and Precision Planting together would have held at least 86 percent of the high-speed precision planting market.
Monsanto Growth Ventures participated in Blue River’s $17 million Series B, which was announced in December 2015.
Though Deere is based in Moline, Illinois, Blue River’s 60-person team will remain in Sunnyvale. The acquisition is expected to be completed next month.
Blue River’s See & Spray equipment uses computer vision and machine learning to help growers reduce the use of herbicides. Its technology analyzes each plant and refers to an image library to determine if it is a weed. If it is, the See & Spray then sprays herbicide directly onto the offending plant, avoiding the crop or surrounding soil. This distinguishes See & Spray from other computer vision-based weed detection methods that analyze growth patterns and colors in patches of plants and makes it much more precise. Other Blue River machines include the LettuceBot, which automatically culls lettuce plants so the others have enough space to thrive, and remote-sensing drones.
In a statement, John May, Deere’s chief information technology officer and president of agricultural solutions, said the company will be able to integrate Blue River’s technology in a wide range of products. “As a leader in precision agriculture, John Deere recognizes the importance of technology to our customers. Machine learning is an important capability for Deere’s future.”",2017-09-06,1537024,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/blueriver.jpg?w=738,startups/,"precision-agriculture,blue-river-technology","After scrapping Monsanto deal, Deere agrees to buy precision farming startup Blue River for $305M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/after-scraping-monsanto-deal-deere-agrees-to-buy-precision-farming-startup-blue-river-for-305m/
"Lucas Matney,Jonathan Shieber",Startups,"Upload, formerly UploadVR, the virtual reality startup at the center of a sexual harassment and wrongful termination lawsuit filed earlier this year, has settled the case with its former employee and is aiming to put the ensuing damage behind it.
The lawsuit, filed against the startup and its co-founders by former director of digital and social media Elizabeth Scott, alleged that the company had sought to create a “boy’s club” environment and described “rampant” sexual behavior in the office, allegations that co-founders Will Mason and Taylor Freeman denied as “entirely without merit.”
The lawsuit is now over, according to people familiar with the matter, and though the terms of the agreement were undisclosed, some in the virtual reality community feel that the company has dodged a bullet in reaching some conclusion over the litigation.
“The matter has been concluded,” was Upload’s official statement. Neither Scott, nor her legal counsel, responded to a request for comment for this story. Upload has also released the following statement around the conclusion of the legal case.
“Our primary focus at Upload is education, which we believe is the key to growing the mixed reality ecosystem. We are deeply committed to creating an inclusive community to empower the pioneers building the future.”
The Upload allegations came at the beginning of a tumultuous summer for technology companies as women (inspired, perhaps, by Susan Fowler’s courageous exposure of harassment at Uber) came forward with stories of inappropriate behavior from venture investors and executives.
In Upload’s case, some former employees wonder whether the company has failed to show real changes have been made in the aftermath of the suit.
“From the other cases that happened along the same lines, either with Uber or 500 Startups, something happened with the people that did those things. They stepped down or publicly apologized or they put processes in place or they got HR or they did something,” one former employee told us. “[Upload’s co-founders] said one little quote and then they dragged a settlement case out for long enough that it wasn’t even news anymore.”
When news of the sexual harassment lawsuit broke in early May, Upload employees were waiting to see what the response of the startup’s co-founders would be to some of their former co-worker’s allegations. When Taylor Freeman and Will Mason denied the merit of all of Scott’s allegations in their official statement, four full-time Upload staffers immediately quit.
What followed were days of “radio silence” from the company’s leadership regarding the scandal, former employees told us, and then suddenly an email asking team members not to talk to the press while they “resolve outstanding issues.” According to people familiar with the company’s thinking, the silence was due to ongoing legal discussions, which kept the founders from discussing the matter publicly.
“When we reflect back on our short history, like any startup, there are things we should have done differently,” Freeman wrote to the startup’s members in an email, obtained by TechCrunch. “But we are also very proud of what we have accomplished, and remain tremendously excited about our future.”
Freeman and Mason faced internal calls to step down following the controversy, sources tell us.
In the weeks following the scandal, key investors distanced themselves from the company and its initial plans to raise a VR/AR-focused venture fund. SEC documents and a since-deleted company web page confirm the startup was looking to raise a $12 million early stage fund for launch in Q3 of this year.
“The decision to put Upload Ventures, which was in its infancy, on hold was a mutual one reached with our partners in order for us to focus more on our core business units in the short term,” an Upload company spokesperson wrote in a statement.
In the months since, the company has looked to move on from the harassment scandal that has engulfed it by hiring new leadership to tackle education and community-building efforts at the company’s SF and LA offices.
Anne Ahola Ward, the chief executive of Circle Click, has stepped in as the company’s new chief operating officer. The company has also brought in Jacquelyn Morie to head up the company’s education efforts.
We received a copy of a blog post that Ward, the company’s incoming COO, posted to the internal Upload site, which attempts to address the aftermath of the lawsuit.
Meanwhile, the company also hired Morie, a former Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Creative Technologies, who has been working in and around virtual worlds almost since the industry’s inception. She spent 13 years at ICT before launching her own company, All These Worlds, to commercialize her work in virtual and augmented reality.
Morie is aware of the company’s recent history and troubles, but insists that Upload is ready, willing and able to move on.
“You can’t judge an entire company on one incident. Whatever that happens to be… unless it is so egregious that the company can’t get beyond it. I don’t think that’s what’s happening here,” Morie told TechCrunch. “I believe that this is a learning opportunity. They will take something that wasn’t working and would try to make it right. If I thought they were not going to address it or deal with and were trying to sweep it under the rug, I wouldn’t be there.”
Not everyone in the industry is convinced that the company has done enough to address the allegations surrounding it or create a safe space for female entrepreneurs in the VR industry.
“I do think they are good guys at heart, but I think they were immature and they… fucked up,” one former employee said of the company’s founders.
With Scott’s lawsuit finished, Upload does still have a community to reassure.
One female founder, who had previously worked with Upload, hopes that women in the VR industry can move to create systems that enable women to talk about their experiences with sexual harassment.
“There’s no safety network for women to speak up,” she said. Asked if Upload should be the one tackling that problem, the founder said that there would likely be “severe trust issues” with such an initiative. “Maybe Upload’s culture changed, but they didn’t even apologize or give an explanation on what they stand for, and that’s a problem because you don’t want to be associated with people who are in a scandal like this without an explanation,” she said.",2017-09-06,1533258,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/17620092_1225290990901923_5575441406705637994_o.jpg?w=738,startups/,"uploadvr,upload","VR company Upload settles sexual harassment suit, though some still feel unsettled",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/vr-company-upload-settles-sexual-harassment-suit-though-some-still-feel-unsettled/
"Matthew Lynley,Katie Roof",Fundings & Exits,"Following up on the news of 23andMe’s huge upcoming financing round, TechCrunch has learned that the company is raising the new financing at a $1.5 billion pre-money valuation. This compares to a $1 billion valuation in its last private round. 
Dan Primack over at Axios reported the same thing this morning, but we’ve heard from our sources the number is indeed accurate. TechCrunch first reported that 23andMe is raising around $200 million in a new financing round led by Sequoia, with Fidelity also looking to participate. 23andMe, an 11-year-old startup (if we can call it that at this point), now looks like it will continue to run as a private company for some time.
The timing makes more sense given that 23andMe seems to have successfully navigated a complex web of regulations and finally gotten the green light to operate in full. The Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to cease sales of its personal genomics test back in 2013. The FDA gave a long-awaited blessing in April this year to go ahead and provide customers with a risk analysis for 10 genetically linked diseases.
That, along with Ancestry.com announcing it filed confidentially for an IPO in June this year, may have emboldened investors to take another big bet on CEO Ann Wojcicki and 23andMe — which had largely leaned on its research and development efforts
23andMe has raised more than $230 million going all the way back to 2007, well before the last generation of massive high-profile consumer IPOs like Twitter and Facebook.

Jason Rowley,Startups,"

For many entrepreneurs, especially first-time founders, raising outside capital can be daunting. Between all of the new vocabulary — like “term sheets,” “capitalization tables,” “pro rata” and different valuation metrics — and the very real legal implications of the agreements being signed, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.
When you’re first starting out (or just need a refresher), it’s often best to learn from examples. So, that’s what we’re going to do today. We’re going to explain the basic mechanics of the first rounds of funding, some of the key terms involved and how different types of financial instruments and deal structures work. Let’s start a company and build a capitalization table! And, for the sake of keeping this accessible, we’re going to try to keep the terms simple.
(Also note: All companies and funds mentioned in this article are fictitious and presented for the sake of example. Any resemblance to real firms is purely coincidental.)
Let’s start at the beginning. Imagine two founders, Jack and Jill. Their idea: The Internet of Wings, a buffalo chicken restaurant featuring drone delivery to all of Silicon Valley and beyond.

They work with a lawyer to set up a corporation. The two decide to split their stakes at a 60-40 ratio, with the majority going to Jill because she’s going to serve as CEO and has the technical background to make the scalable part of the business — drone-based delivery — a reality. They also decide to set aside 20 percent of the shares in an equity pool for future employees. So, here’s how the ownership stakes break down at the start:
Internet of Wings Inc. (abbreviated IoW, like IoT, but involving poultry) was established as a Delaware C corporation — the standard type of legal entity for venture-backed startups — with 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding, issued at a par value of $0.001 per share. With this, in the eyes of the law, the company is now valued at $10,000. Here is the capitalization table for the company at this point:

Jack sets to work developing a chicken sandwich that appears to be lovingly hand-crafted, even when produced at industrial scale. And he may or may not have taken “inspiration” from Apple’s patented pizza boxes when creating packaging to keep the sandwiches intact and warm, but not soggy, during the short airlift from IoW’s rented kitchen space to the customer. Meanwhile, Jill hacks together a drone capable of flying chicken sandwiches hither and yon.
After months of working nights and weekends, they go to a park — their Kitty Hawk — and successfully make their first flight, which was captured on video and subsequently went viral on Periscope. With demonstrated demand for the novel idea but no cash to cover the costs of the business, Jill determines it’s time to raise some outside capital in a seed round.
Seed rounds come in two main flavors: priced and unpriced. A priced seed round is much like any other round of funding in that the company is given a valuation, and shares in the company are purchased for cash by investors at a price determined by that valuation.
But today, due to their popularity relative to their priced cousins, as well as their unique structures and financial instruments, we’re going to focus on unpriced seed rounds in this section.
As the name suggests, in an unpriced round, the company is not given a valuation, and the investor isn’t necessarily purchasing a known amount of equity at the time of investment. Rather, it’s an agreement between the investor and the company to issue shares in a future, priced round in exchange for an infusion of cash at the time the unpriced Seed deal is struck.
The two most common financial instruments used in unpriced seed rounds are convertible notes and so-called Simple Agreements for Future Equity (or “SAFE notes”). A convertible note is a financial instrument that is issued first as debt, but then converts to equity under predetermined conditions, such as raising a priced round. A SAFE note is like a convertible note, except it’s not a debt instrument, meaning that SAFE notes don’t carry an obligation to pay interest. Introduced in late 2013 by Y Combinator, the prominent Silicon Valley-based incubator program, SAFE notes are generally thought to be more founder-friendly than convertible notes precisely because they aren’t treated like debt, so they don’t have a maturity date or interest payments associated with them. And as an added point of convenience, the agreements tend to be short, and there are comparatively fewer terms for founders to negotiate.
Because seed investors take on a lot of risk by investing in very early-stage companies, they’ll oftentimes add a number of provisions to their investment agreements to ensure they get a sufficiently large piece of the company to justify that risk. Two of the most common provisions in unpriced rounds are “discounts” and “valuation caps.”
True to its name, a discount provision grants investors the right to purchase shares at a discount from the price of shares in the next funding round. In this case, the next round is Series A, which is typically the first priced funding round a company experiences (and the point at which the convertible note or SAFE would convert to shares). Separately, a valuation cap puts a ceiling on the valuation of the company such that the investor can ensure they get a certain percentage share of a company. This helps prevent a runaway valuation from squeezing the percentage share they’d be able to purchase in the company.
Back to Jack and Jill. They decide to raise capital in an unpriced seed round for their startup. They figure they need to raise $5 million to get their company off the ground. After soliciting introductions from their network, and lots of back and forth, they find two investors eager to commit the entirety of the round.
Opaque Ventures agrees to a $2.5 million SAFE with a 20 percent discount provision, and BlackBox Capital will invest $2.5 million in a SAFE that has a $10 million valuation cap on the company’s pre-money valuation. Agreements are signed, money is wired to the company’s bank account and Jack and Jill resume the process of building their venture.
It’s important to note that at this time no new shares have been created, and the value of the company remains the same because, again, this is an “unpriced” round where no new value is assigned.
Fast-forward 18 months. Business is booming, with a fleet of drones buzzing all around the Bay Area delivering chicken sandwiches to hungry customers. Jill and Jack have marshalled the financial resources from their seed round well, having invested heavily in R&D, a few good engineering hires and a few agreements with drone manufacturers overseas. But despite rapid growth, the company isn’t profitable and only has eight months left before it runs out of cash.
It’s time to raise a Series A round. If a company hasn’t already raised a priced round, Series A is typically when the shares of a startup receive their first valuation.
Amongst venture capitalists and other startup investors, it’s common to hear two types of valuations mentioned: “pre-money” and “post-money.” Put simply, a pre-money valuation is the value of the company prior to (hence “pre-”) the round’s infusion of capital. The post-money valuation is the value of the company after the round is complete, and it’s usually calculated by adding the amount of money raised in the round to the pre-money valuation.
Jack and Jill went to Sand Hill to raise their Series A. They want to raise $7 million. They meet with many, many investors, and ultimately work out a deal with two new firms. One of their previous investors, BlackBox, opted to participate in the round. Here’s the breakdown:
Analysts at Cormorant Ventures determine that Internet of Wings Inc. is worth $15 million prior to any investment. This is its “pre-money valuation.” Although it’s tempting to think that the company’s post-money valuation would be $22 million (by summing the pre-money valuation and the amount being raised here) we’ll see that the post-money valuation is actually a bit higher due to the discount and cap provisions used by the seed investors.
The final signing of checks and legal paperwork sets off a cascade of conversions and capitalization table adjustments as the company issues new shares to its investors.
Let’s start with our seed investors whose investments will convert to equity at this stage.
Opaque Ventures invested $2.5 million in a SAFE with the ability to purchase shares at a 20 percent discount to the pre-money valuation at Series A. The Series A price is $1.50 per share ($15 million pre-money valuation divided by 10 million shares, the number of shares originally created when the firm was incorporated, which we noted earlier), so at a 20 percent discount ($1.20 per share), Opaque Ventures’ $2.5 million investment converts to 2,083,333 shares ($2.5 million divided by $1.20 per share) valued at $3.125 million, a 1.25x multiple on invested capital.
In the seed round, BlackBox Capital invested $2.5 million in a SAFE with a valuation cap of $10 million. This allows them to purchase shares at $1.00 per share ($10 million cap / 10 million shares outstanding), resulting in the purchase of 2.5 million shares from their seed investment. At the new $1.50 share price, BlackBox Capital’s seed investment is now valued at $3.75 million, a 1.5x multiple on invested capital.
At a Series A stock price of $1.50, Cormorant Ventures purchased 2,666,666 shares with its $4 million investment. Provident Capital purchased 1,333,333 shares with its $2 million investment. And with its $1 million follow-on funding in the Series A round, BlackBox Capital purchases an additional 666,666 shares of Series A stock.
Here’s how the ownership of the company breaks down after the Series A round. Let’s start first with our capitalization table after the Series A funding round is complete:

The post-money valuation of the company after raising its Series A round is roughly $28.875 million. Recall our temptation to say the post-money valuation should be $22 million ($15 million pre-money valuation plus $7 million raised in the round), but that would be incorrect in this case.
Clauses like valuation caps and discounts allow investors to purchase shares at a price lower than the prevailing price per share. This increases the number of shares they are able to purchase, and thus results in more shares being created.
To further illustrate that, let’s think about what would have happened if IoW’s seed investors didn’t implement caps or discounts. They would have been issued stock at the regular share price of $1.50 and, accordingly, wound up with a smaller percentage of the company. The terms they put into their investment agreements both raised the post-money valuation of the company by generating more shares and served to give these investors a larger chunk of the company than they’d otherwise be entitled to if they purchased shares at the $1.50/share price paid by Series A investors.
Here’s the percentage breakdown of the company’s different share classes between seed and Series A rounds:

One of the other important things to note is that, on a percentage basis, Jack, Jill and the employee equity pool’s relative share of the company has decreased on a percentage basis. This is known as dilution. Financially, dilution isn’t really a big deal, because even a shrinking slice of the proverbial pie is still valuable if the size of the pie — the value of the company — continues to grow. For example, although holders of Common Stock own just 52 percent of the company after its Series A round, their collective stake is now valued at $15 million. And so long as share prices continue to increase in subsequent rounds, the value of their stock will continue to increase, as well, even as they continue to be diluted.
(Down rounds flip the math here, both diluting current shareholders and driving down the value of their stake. More on that in a coming piece.)
Where dilution does matter, though, is in the control and voting structure of the company. In most voting agreements, voting power is often tied to the number and type of shares held by a given shareholder; founders and other investors can find themselves outnumbered during key votes as their percentage ownership of the company is diluted. This is the principal reason why many investors include anti-dilution provisions — to maintain their control in a company.
Raising outside money is one of the more esoteric aspects of being an entrepreneur, but it doesn’t need to be confusing. Although we used relatively simple terms here, we discussed the differences between pre- and post-money valuations, saw how different types of deal terms affect valuation and percentage ownership and explained how raising new rounds of funding can lead to dilution of founders’ and early investors’ stakes in a company over time.
Things are often considerably messier in the real world, but the underlying mechanics discussed here still hold.

Matthew Lynley,Mobile,"Tenka Labs co-founder John Schuster is no stranger to walking friends through building gadgets using Arduino, an open-source hardware controller — except they might be great software engineers, but not understand the actual circuitry.
But Tenka Labs, which builds simple kits that help young students create small gadgets with the use of motors and other bits that connect to legos, is looking to be an even more basic starting point to understanding engineering. Instead of jumping straight into designing a circuit, Tenka Labs makes what are called Circuit Cubes — kits that include lights or motors — that plug into Legos to teach the true basics of engineering. The company said that it has raised an additional $2 million in seed funding, and is also launching in several retailers for the holiday season.
“Before they go onto designing circuits, we need to get them to understand the basics,” co-founder Nate MacDonald said. “When they can see and understand it, they’re more comfortable to invent. They understand that the wires are making that motor go, and then they can create things like an electric toothbrush. The stores recognize parents are looking for an educational toy. You can see it online, and there’s a wave happening where schools are starting to have maker spaces. They’re changing woodworking shops into engineering labs.”
Because the company is essentially producing a toy, getting into retailers is ahead of the holiday season is going to be key. That’s especially true for toys like Circuit Cubes, which are primed to be potential gifts from parents or relatives looking to get kids interested in engineering. That can then kick off the virtuous cycle: kids enjoy it; the parents, teachers, and friends notice it; and then more and more families start buying it.
Starting off from such a very basic point is one way to get those kids excited about engineering, and get them up to speed, Schuster says. The blocks plug and play: you stick Legos on top of it to build anything from a fully operational medieval castle, which Schuster saw at a camp over the summer, to a part of a doll house. “There’s electronic, physical, mechanical, but they don’t even now that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.
“There are electronic, physical, and mechanical parts, but they don’t even realize that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.
Tenka Labs, which says it is launching in Target, Micro Center, Barnes & Noble (which still exists, apparently), Amazon, and MoMA stores, will certainly face uphill battles. It’s going to have to continue engaging kids and parents, hopefully tapping that same desire that would encourage them to go to Radio Shack and pick up a proto board and motor. It can do that by adding new blocks down the line, but also at some point contend with the idea that the students may be more attracted to littleBits (or graduate into them).
The key question for the company — and one that it naturally got from many investors — is whether it will actually be able to spin up the kind of manufacturing it needs in order to get those toys into stores. Schuster spent more than a month abroad to try to figure out the manufacturing, and the company also soft launched it with a program called Steve & Kate’s Summer Camp to gauge demand. One of the children there actually created a sort of pinwheel with the light kit that displayed a stop-motion video of a running horse, which emboldened Schuster and MacDonald even more as they looked to pique the curiosity of kids.
“We know there were good products but there was nothing fun and playful,” Schuster said. “That’s why we’re here, we’re filling a niche that had a need. These were the three favorite things they wanted to do. They wanted to make flashlights, battle their cars together and make this weird artwork. You can imagine your mom saying, grab me the flashlight, the kid says I’ll make you one. They go on the adventure, we’re not gonna script what they build and create.”",2017-09-06,1536554,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/vertical-kits.png?w=738,startups/,"tenka-labs,littlebits,circuit-cubes,lego",Tenka Labs raises another $2M to get its kids’ LEGO engineering kits in retailers,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/tenka-labs-raises-another-2m-to-get-its-kids-lego-engineering-kits-in-retailers/
Anthony Ha,Media,"Scribd is giving college and graduate students access to its library of digital content, plus a subscription to The New York Times, at what it says is a 40 percent discount on the combination.
CEO Trip Adler told me students already make up a significant portion of the subscribers who pay to read e-books, audiobooks, magazine articles and more. (We’ve described Scribd as an all-you-can-read service, but that’s not quite accurate anymore, as it limits access to some of its titles through a monthly credit system.)
The company recently expanded into newspaper articles, so Scribd subscribers can already read select New York Times content. The new Essential Student Bundle, however, includes a full access to the Times library — Adler explained that while Scribd will handle all the billing, subscribers will get a separate login to the NYT website and apps.
To sign up, a student verifies their status through SheerID, then they make a one-time, $29.99 payment that covers a four-month period. (That breaks down to $1.87 per week.)
Adler added that this is just the first of what could be a number of different bundling options that Scribd offers. And they won’t necessarily be limited to students.
“Obviously, we’re big fans of the subscription model for media,” he said, but he argued that with so many different options out there, there’s a risk of “subscription fatigue” — so bundling different services into one subscription is a way to fight that. “This is just the beginning of what could be a really interesting new strategy and direction.”",2017-09-06,1536647,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nyt_studentbundle_pressimage.jpg?w=738,startups/,"the-new-york-times,scribd","Scribd offers an ‘Essential Student Bundle’, including an NYT subscription, for $1.87 per week",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/scribd-nyt-bundle/

In fact, the company also announced that one of the product’s earliest customers, Capital One, will be investing $5 million in Snowflake as a strategic investor as a result of this new approach.
Most Snowflake customers use the product in a multi-tenant cloud where users share resources across the service, but the new Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) service gives customers a dedicated set of resources, says company CEO Bob Muglia.
“The key is that it’s dedicated. We are running the data privately and have encrypted computers fully dedicated to [the individual] customer,” Muglia told TechCrunch.
Snowflake has created this private version of its product to meet the very specific needs of regulated customers. In practice, that means each VPS customer gets a managed version of Snowflake inside a dedicated AWS Virtual Private Cloud instance. In addition, they also get control of their own encryption keys and other features like industry-specific compliance such as HIPAA for healthcare and PCI DSS for credit card payments.
As for the investment, Muglia says Capital One’s venture arm, Capital One Growth Venture Partners, took an interest as they were working with the credit card giant, and announced the investment this week after concluding the business side of the arrangement.
The investment is actually tacked onto the $100 million Series D round from April 2017 for a total of $105 million for those of you keeping track at home. With this additional money, Snowflake has raised a total of $210 million in funding.
The company has over 750 customers and 270 employees, up from 175 in April when it announced the $100 million funding round.",2017-09-06,1536434,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-579947425.jpg?w=738,startups/,"data-warehouse,databases,capital-one,snowflake",Snowflake’s newest cloud data warehouse takes aim at regulated industries,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/snowflakes-newest-cloud-data-warehouse-takes-aim-at-regulated-industries/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Dataiku, a French startup that helps data analysts communicate with data scientists to build more meaningful data applications, announced a significant funding round today.
The company scored a $28 million Series B investment led by Battery Ventures with help from FirstMark, Serena Capital and Alven. Today’s money brings the total raised to almost $45 million. Its most recent prior round was a $14 million Series A in October 2016.
Dataiku has developed Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS), which CEO Florian Douetteau says has been designed to solve communications problems between data analysts and data scientists.
“It’s a platform for working together. Data analysts can click around the data while applying machine learning, and data scientists can code and do whatever they want to do to extend the work of analysts,” Douetteau told TechCrunch.
“Data science is no longer a niche subsector of analytics like it was 20 years ago,” Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at investor Battery Ventures said in a statement. “The DSS product enables technical data scientists to work alongside data analysts to help build and deploy models into production. We feel that a platform that allows users of different skill sets to work together is the future of data science products,” he added.
 
Douetteau says the platform is more than just an extension of business intelligence tools we’ve been seeing since the 1990s. His company is enabling the analysts to work on the data in much more sophisticated ways, while collaborating with more technical people in the same interface. As an example, he says that one of the big use cases is media buying.
Say for example that your company wanted to buy ads in Northern Ireland. You could use DSS to find ad data to determine the best time of day to run your ads. You could then find the perfect medium for your ad buy, whether that’s radio, TV, print, online or some combination. The data analysts can manipulate the ad data to the extent that they can, then work with more technical folks to go deeper and generate results that go beyond the analyst level of expertise.
The company, which has a 100 employees, plans to double that number in the in the next few months. That expansion will touch every department including helping customers with deployment and further building out the platform to add more features.
“We want to be the universal platform for data science where you can do anything you imagine for advanced data analytics,” Douetteau said.",2017-09-06,1536144,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-158317656.jpg?w=738,startups/,"data-analysis,data-analytics,data-science,dataiku",Dataiku to enhance data tools with $28 million investment led by Battery Ventures,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/dataiku-to-enhance-data-tools-with-28-million-infusion-led-by-battery-ventures/
Darrell Etherington,Automotive,"Turo has a new strategic partner in automaker Daimler, with ties solidified through both an investment by Daimler in the car-sharing startup and through the acquisition by Turo of Croove, Daimler’s own Turo-like subsidiary.
The funding is part of a new $92 million Series D round raised by Turo, which was also led by South Korean giant SK Holdings, in addition to Daimler, and which includes participation from new investors Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures and Founders Circle Capital, as well as from existing partners.
This investment includes a lot of new strategic tie-ups for Turo, which allows individual vehicle owners and small rental fleet operators to offer their cars up for short-term rentals by others. Liberty Mutual is clearly a key asset thanks to its insurance industry perspective, and this deepens the relationship between the two companies, since Liberty already provides insurance for cars on Turo’s sharing platform.
SK Holdings has a number of sub-companies, including SK Telecom, with ties to the automotive industry, and they’ve also recently been investing heavily in new mobility brands. These include SoCar, as well as leading short-term car rental services in other Southeast Asian manufacturers like Malaysia. They represent a partner with potentially far-reaching impact for Turo.
“They have several SK companies that are involved closely with OEMs,” explained Turo CEO Andre Haddad in an interview. “They provide parts and systems for car manufacturers based in Korea, as well as global manufacturers of cars. Recently, they started investing in mobility services. They found that Turo, with our global perspective, and they’re keen on positioning themselves in what they believe is going to be a significant part of how people access, buy, sell and finance cars in the future.”
Haddad points out that the number of cars on the road is fastest growing in Asia, and he says SK also invested because  they believe they also can help with Turo’s Asia expansion plans in general.
Daimler’s investment is unique, since it also comes alongside Turo’s acquisition of its Croove business. Croove, which launched in December last year, was a car-sharing business that Daimler fully owned, which launched in Germany initially. It offered a very similar model to Turo, allowing anyone to rent their vehicle on a peer-to-peer basis, and it was open to vehicles of any make and model.
“We had a lot of interest from a bunch of OEMs in this round, and we had great conversations with a lot of those OEMs,” explained Haddad. “One of the things we particularly liked about Daimler was that they were not just talking the talk, they were walking the walk with their direct investment in incubating and launching Croove. We do believe that our platform Turo and peer-to-peer car sharing is fundamentally going to evolve car ownership and we believe that partnering with an OEM that has already expressed their deep interest and belief in this phenomenon by building their own business with Croove was a differentiator.”
Once the investment in Turo by Daimler was agreed upon, Haddad says it made no sense for the automaker to continue to operate its own separate peer-to-peer car sharing business, hence the decision to put Croove in Turo’s hands. As to why it went that way, when a lot of OEMs seem to be going in the other direction and acquiring younger mobility startups, Haddad says it’s about recognition on both sides of how the model works.
“For peer-to-peer car sharing to be really successful, it needs to be operated within an open platform where anyone can participate,” he said. “We believe very strongly that peer-to-peer marketplaces are only great when they are open and accessible. I think there was mutual recognition of this fundamental nature of peer-to-peer marketplaces, and I believe that’s the reason why Daimler are also very clear on this dynamic.”
Haddad said the details of how the transition will work in practice are still being worked out, but the plan is not to operate separate brands for long, and to launch Turo in Germany in place of the Croove brand in a matter of “weeks and months,” not years.",2017-09-06,1536592,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/andre.jpg?w=738,startups/,"daimler,turo",Turo raises $92M and acquires Daimler’s Croove car-sharing business,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/turo-raises-92m-and-acquires-daimlers-croove-car-sharing-business/
Anthony Ha,Advertising Tech,"Pendo helps businesses understand and assist their customers with tools like analytics, polls and walkthroughs. Until now, however, CEO Todd Olson said the company has been focused on the web (both desktop and mobile), with just a single mobile developer on the team.
“We as a team constantly had a lot of internal debates about how much to invest in [mobile],” he said. “If you want to do it, you have to really invest in it.”
That’s why the company has made its first acquisition — it’s buying Insert, a mobile marketing startup based in Israel. Olson told me that he connected with Insert through Battery Ventures, which backed both companies, and he saw their product as doing “essentially what we do, but for mobile devices.”
There are some differences, he acknowledged, since Insert is more focused on mobile messaging and less on analytics. But in Olson’s view, the Insert team has already done “all the hard work” of creating a platform that marketers and product designers can use, and integrating that product with native mobile apps.
“The key is doing it without developers,” he said. So with Insert, Pendo can build a platform that allows teams to engage with customers and improve their product across devices, and to do so without developer assistance: “The vision is to combine the products into one simple platform.”
Pendo recently raised a $25 million Series C, partly to fund acquisitions and international expansion — it looks like the Insert deal covers both. (Insert’s Tel Aviv office will also become Pendo’s first international location.) Insert, meanwhile, raised a $10 million round from Battery last year.
The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Olson said the combined companies have a headcount of 145 employees.
“With Insert, Pendo acquires a team that shares its passion for great product experiences,” said Insert founder and CEO Shahar Kaminitz in the acquisition announcement. “This combined platform allows product teams to better understand mobile users and deliver personalized experiences on the right mobile moments, when users are likely to get the best value.”",2017-09-07,1537220,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/pendo-office.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"battery-ventures,insert,pendo",Pendo acquires Insert to add mobile apps to its user analytics and engagement platform,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/pendo-acquires-insert/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"Apple is pushing the limits of its beta program as the company just released the tenth beta version of iOS 11. If you have a developer account and want to try out the next version of iOS, you can download the new beta version right now.
iOS 11 is the next major release of the operating system for the iPhone and iPad. Apple first unveiled iOS 11 at its WWDC event back in June 2017. Developers and early adopters have been able to try out the new version for three months.
And the wait is almost over as Apple should release iOS 11 a week after the new iPhone event on September 12. Existing iPhone and iPad owners will be able to update for free.
At this point, beta versions of iOS 11 feel quite stable. I wouldn’t recommend installing iOS 11 on the iPhone you use every day — beta versions of iOS usually drain your battery life. But if you have an iPad and are feeling adventurous, you can install it right now.
If you have a developer account and pay $99 per year to access new betas, developer tools and content, you can download iOS 11 beta 10 on Apple’s developer website. If you don’t want to pay $99, Apple now has a public beta program.
The iPad is going to receive the biggest changes in iOS 11. The update turns your iPad into a more capable tablet as you can drag and drop files, app icons and more across the operating system. There’s a system-wide dock, a new app switcher and a Files app so you can launch apps and manage your documents more easily.
If you don’t have an iPad, most of the changes are under the hood, starting with Apple’s augmented reality framework ARKit. Many developers have been working on ARKit-enabled apps, but they’re not in the App Store just yet. There’s also a completely redesigned Control Center with customizable shortcuts.

Matthew Lynley,Mobile,"Tenka Labs co-founder John Schuster is no stranger to walking friends through building gadgets using Arduino, an open-source hardware controller — except they might be great software engineers, but not understand the actual circuitry.
But Tenka Labs, which builds simple kits that help young students create small gadgets with the use of motors and other bits that connect to legos, is looking to be an even more basic starting point to understanding engineering. Instead of jumping straight into designing a circuit, Tenka Labs makes what are called Circuit Cubes — kits that include lights or motors — that plug into Legos to teach the true basics of engineering. The company said that it has raised an additional $2 million in seed funding, and is also launching in several retailers for the holiday season.
“Before they go onto designing circuits, we need to get them to understand the basics,” co-founder Nate MacDonald said. “When they can see and understand it, they’re more comfortable to invent. They understand that the wires are making that motor go, and then they can create things like an electric toothbrush. The stores recognize parents are looking for an educational toy. You can see it online, and there’s a wave happening where schools are starting to have maker spaces. They’re changing woodworking shops into engineering labs.”
Because the company is essentially producing a toy, getting into retailers is ahead of the holiday season is going to be key. That’s especially true for toys like Circuit Cubes, which are primed to be potential gifts from parents or relatives looking to get kids interested in engineering. That can then kick off the virtuous cycle: kids enjoy it; the parents, teachers, and friends notice it; and then more and more families start buying it.
Starting off from such a very basic point is one way to get those kids excited about engineering, and get them up to speed, Schuster says. The blocks plug and play: you stick Legos on top of it to build anything from a fully operational medieval castle, which Schuster saw at a camp over the summer, to a part of a doll house. “There’s electronic, physical, mechanical, but they don’t even now that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.
“There are electronic, physical, and mechanical parts, but they don’t even realize that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.
Tenka Labs, which says it is launching in Target, Micro Center, Barnes & Noble (which still exists, apparently), Amazon, and MoMA stores, will certainly face uphill battles. It’s going to have to continue engaging kids and parents, hopefully tapping that same desire that would encourage them to go to Radio Shack and pick up a proto board and motor. It can do that by adding new blocks down the line, but also at some point contend with the idea that the students may be more attracted to littleBits (or graduate into them).
The key question for the company — and one that it naturally got from many investors — is whether it will actually be able to spin up the kind of manufacturing it needs in order to get those toys into stores. Schuster spent more than a month abroad to try to figure out the manufacturing, and the company also soft launched it with a program called Steve & Kate’s Summer Camp to gauge demand. One of the children there actually created a sort of pinwheel with the light kit that displayed a stop-motion video of a running horse, which emboldened Schuster and MacDonald even more as they looked to pique the curiosity of kids.
“We know there were good products but there was nothing fun and playful,” Schuster said. “That’s why we’re here, we’re filling a niche that had a need. These were the three favorite things they wanted to do. They wanted to make flashlights, battle their cars together and make this weird artwork. You can imagine your mom saying, grab me the flashlight, the kid says I’ll make you one. They go on the adventure, we’re not gonna script what they build and create.”",2017-09-06,1536554,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/vertical-kits.png?w=738,mobile/,"tenka-labs,littlebits,lego",Tenka Labs raises another $2M to get its kids’ LEGO engineering kits in retailers,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/tenka-labs-raises-another-2m-to-get-its-kids-lego-engineering-kits-in-retailers/
Natasha Lomas,Advertising Tech,"U.S. carrier Verizon has launched a new rewards program as it pushes for more lucrative ways to eke money out of a subscriber base that’s not growing as easily as it once was. (Disclosure: Verizon is the parent company of TechCrunch’s parent, Oath (formerly AOL; Oath being formed from the merging of AOL and Yahoo)
As the WSJ notes, the more than 600,000 subscribers the company added in the last quarter had to be wooed with cut prices and revived unlimited data offerings — so that type of growth is more costly to its bottom line. While revenue generated by the company’s core wireless business in 2016 was 2.7 per cent down on the year before.
Verizon is therefore intent on transforming into an “information company” which sells “experiences” on top of connectivity, and looks for ways to “optimize the monetization” — including making use of machine learning and AI, as the company’s EVP and president, Ronan Dunne, put it in comments at a conference last month. (For “optimize the monetization” read: target ads to our existing subscriber-base to ramp up our share of the digital advertising market.)
In a promo video for Verizon Up, as the new program is called, the wireless giant claims its motivation for giving customers who sign up for the program one credit (which is good for one reward) for every $300 they spend on their monthly bill — which they can redeem on a variety of offers from Starbucks coffee to TV shows to movie premiers to concert tickets — is “just because you’re with Verizon”. “Because, thanks,” they add.

Of course the truth is rather less one-sided.
A legal disclaimer on the Verizon Up sign up page notes that only those customers who sign up for Verizon Select are eligible for the rewards program. So what is Verizon Selects? It’s Verizon’s ad-targeting program, which targets marketing based on users’ personal data.
So, in plain English, Verizon is saying: let us use your browsing, location, interests and other personal data for marketing purposes — and we’ll let you participate in our earn-rewards program.
Verizon Selects targets ads based on users’ web browsing, app usage, device location, use of Verizon services and “other information about you (such as your postal/email addresses, demographics, and interests)” — sharing this information with Oath (aka the digital media entity formed after the recent merging of Verizon acquisitions, AOL and Yahoo) in order to power wider ad-targeting of Verizon users across its devices and services.
The data is also being used to personalize the rewards individual users see in Verizon Up, the company’s FAQ says.
The wider context here is that Oath is Verizon’s bid to better compete for digital ad spend with the personal-data-harvesting ad-targeting specialists of the Internet: aka Google and Facebook.
Regulation of how telcos can use personal data has typically been tighter than for Internet services but earlier this year the FCC reversed tighter privacy rules for broadband providers — thereby giving giants like Verizon more room for their data-harvesting, ad-tracking manoeuvres.
Interestingly, Verizon is not auto-enrolling all users in the rewards/data-sharing program — so is evidently taking things a little more cautiously than it could technically, given the current lack of a robust regulatory framework covering U.S. ISP privacy.
As TechCrunch wrote in March, when the broadband privacy rules were reversed —
— with only the potential possibility of the FTC regaining privacy oversight of ISPs in future to provide some pause for thought in how wireless providers go about sucking up and sharing their customers’ data.
Writing in the Hill in March, at the time of the broadband privacy rule reversal, FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny warned of what she couched as “part of a larger effort to substantially shift the risks of data security from companies to consumers and to weaken consumer privacy choices”.
Even so, ISPs face the risk of losing customers’ trust if they are perceived to be playing fast and loose with their privacy — so perhaps a sense of needing to balance these sorts of trust issues is feeding into Verizon’s decision to make the program opt-in, as well as wider regulatory considerations.
On the latter, earlier this year Verizon agreed to paid a $1.35M fine to the FCC which had been investigating its user of so-called “supercookies” to target ads — and also agreed it would ask users to opt-in before sharing data with third parties. So that penalty is serving as a recent ‘regulatory considerations’ reminder.
Commenting about the new Verizon Up program to the WSJ, Diego Scotti, Verizon’s chief marketing officer, pointed to tech giants like Google and Facebook, saying: “Some of our competitors, they have exactly the same thing, it’s just buried in the terms and conditions of the service. We are not hiding anything.”
Although there’s still at least a technical difference between an Internet application that people choose to use, like Facebook, and an ISP that provides Internet connectivity, with only limited alternatives for accessing the Internet if someone wants to ditch their ISP (even if lots of web users might feel they cannot easily ditch Facebook or Google, either).
Verizon users opting to share their personal data with Oath for ad-targeting purposes can withdraw their consent (via logging in to a preferences page) — however an FAQ on the program suggests that users’ data is unlikely to be immediately deleted. “Information used for Verizon Selects while you are a participant may be kept for up to three years,” it states.
“Information previously collected may continue to be used for analytics and modeling purposes,” the FAQ further notes.

Josh Constine,Apps,"Today Facebook officially opened its new Watch tab of original video content to everyone in the U.S. after a limited rollout a month ago and expansion to some more users last week. Available on Facebook’s native mobile apps, desktop site, and TV apps, Watch lets users subscribe to their favorite series instead of just haphazardly stumbling upon one-off videos in the News Feed. U.S. users will now see the TV icon in the mobile navigation bar and desktop site bookmarks.
Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to ensure that user generated videos don’t get taken down for including music owned by the major record labels. Bloomberg reports Facebook is offering the labels hundreds of millions of dollars for a deal that would let infringing videos stay up, rather than be removed to the great annoyance of users.
Facebook had planned to build out a YouTube Content ID-style system so labels could detect uses of their music and claim a cut of monetization from then instead of just issuing blunt takedown notices. But Bloomberg says that system could take up to two years to build, and Facebook is willing to pay now to stop the takedowns.
Facebook is offering a range of different options for discovering video content, including a carousel of featured programs, and sections like “Today’s Spotlight”, “New This Week”, “Popular Now”, “What Friends Are Watching”, “Most Talked About”, “Suggested For You”, and a special “10 Minutes Or More” spot for long-form videos.

For now, Facebook is primarily highlighting reality shows, which partners are producing en masse since they’re cheap, don’t require set scripts, and can be watched piece-meal. But to really seduce audiences who frequent YouTube, Netflix, and cable TV, Facebook will need high quality scripted comedies and dramas.
One of the first signs of this content is the sci-fi short film ‘Lost Memories’ by independent filmmaker Francois Ferracci about a future “over-saturated by holograms”. Beyond that, its current offering isn’t very appealing, as the shows lack stars, big budgets, or cliff-hangers. But if you’re the type to just turn on the Discovery Channel and lay back on the couch, you might find some fun time-wasters on Facebook Watch.",2017-09-05,1536327,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/facebook-watch.png?w=738,mobile/,"facebook-video,facebook-watch",Facebook Watch original video tab launches to all U.S. users,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facebook-watch-tab/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Lightricks, the company behind the popular selfie-correcting app called Facetune, is adding to its line of mobile photography and editing tools with the recent launch of a new app called Quickshot. Like its other efforts in this space, Quickshot aims to make photo editing more accessible to amateurs. However, in this case, the app’s focus is to assist with taking photos, not just correcting them after the fact.
The app’s name references one tool in particular – a “quickshot” mode which will automatically align your photos, fix the lighting and preview filters before you even snap the picture. The idea is that you’ll be able to take better photos if you can see what they’ll look like before you press the capture button.
Other modes include the “strobe” mode that lets you capture action and movement by mimicking strobe lights and long exposures, and an “HDR” mode that helps with tricky lighting situations.

Beyond these different camera modes, the app also ships with a range of adjustable presets for various scenes, like portraits, nature, urban, and more. That way, novice photographers don’t have to fiddle with various settings to take the best photo, while more advanced users can load a preset then tweak it further to their liking.

The ability to customize your filter in order to give your photos a unique, personalized look is something that draws people to other top photo apps, like Instagram, Snapseed, and VSCO, for example. But with Quickshot, the larger idea is to combine favorite tools like photo filters with Lightricks’ understanding of making photo edits easier through tricks like instant fixes and other tools that can speed up the process.
For example, Quickshot’s batch editor that lets you adjust a single style – like the filter, brightness, depth and more – and then apply it multiple images all at once.

Quickshot is the latest app in a growing lineup of apps from Lightricks, which has been aiming to capitalize on its success with Facetune to launch a subscription business for its creativity tools. Earlier this summer, it debuted a new photo editor called Enlight Photofox, which is basically the upgraded version of the existing Enlight app.
It’s still somewhat rare to see this strategy play out on today’s App Store. Developers are often expected to roll out new features as upgrades to existing apps, not as new ones. Tweetbot, a Twitter client, has been one exception to this rule, which applies more so to apps than games. It’s far more common for sequels to arrive as their own standalone games, as with Monument 2, for instance.
Like Enlight Photofox and Facetune 2, Quickshot is also a subscription offering. While the app itself is free, an “unlimited access subscription” offers all the app’s features and content, for either $1.99 per month, $0.83 per month if you pay for a year upfront, or $19.99 for life.
Because of this model, Quickshot is getting slammed in the App Store reviews from those who feel like it doesn’t offer enough features to justify this pricing. The app currently has a 2.3-star rating (out of 5). This, unfortunately, speaks to a larger problem with the App Store’s business model – developers who believe their work is worth paying for are penalized because there are so many free alternatives available they have to compete against, and because the App Store has propagated the belief that because apps are small, they should cost less than desktop software.
Lightricks, before the shift to subscriptions, sold a healthy 11 million paid downloads of its apps. But despite the pushback from users about subscriptions, the company claims they’ve enabled it to increase revenues.
“Regarding the pivot to subscription model we can definitely confirm that there has a been a significant uptick in revenue run rates,” says Itai Tsiddon, Lightricks co-founder. “However, at this time, we are not yet disclosing specific numbers,” he says, adding that the company will release more details around the end of year.",2017-09-05,1536148,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/quickshot-ios.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"photography,photos,apps,lightricks","Facetune maker’s latest app, Quickshot, helps you take better photos",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facetune-makers-latest-app-quickshot-helps-you-take-better-photos/
Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"WhatsApp is gearing up to finally monetize its messaging app by charging large enterprise businesses for tools to better communicate with customers. WhatsApp will also offer a free app to small-to-medium sized businesses, though it hasn’t outlined the specific functionality of the app. The enterprise solution will allow global companies “to provide customers with useful notifications like flight times, delivery confirmations, and other updates”.
“We do intend on charging businesses in the future,” WhatsApp’s Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema told the Wall Street Journal. “We don’t have the details of monetization figured out.”
The company did write that it wants to facilitate “someone placing an order with a local bakery or looking at new styles from a clothing store” and “shopkeepers who use WhatsApp to stay in touch with hundreds of customers from a single smartphone”, plus offer “an easier way to respond to messages.”
Perhaps WhatsApp could charge enterprises like “airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks” to have multiple representatives managing an account or sending high volumes of messages. It could also charge for artificial intelligence bot functionality or ecommerce transactions.
WhatsApp also officially announced its closed pilot program for verifying business accounts with a green checkmark to distinguish them from personal accounts and fakes.
WhatsApp began testing verified accounts for businesses a week ago. Conversations with businesses are encrypted and they can be blocked. Interestingly, if a business isn’t already in your phone number contacts, its name will appear as whatever they register themselves as instead of their number. This could allow WhatsApp to create a business search engine with optional sponsored results, or let businesses cold-message people, possibly for a fee.
Alternatively, businesses on WhatsApp may need to be contacted by a user first before they can respond with organic or sponsored messages. That’s how Facebook Messenger works, and it’s led to businesses buying “tap-to-message” ads on Facebook’s News Feed to get people to initiate conversations so the business can follow up with sponsored messages. Not allowing cold-message ads meshes with WhatsApp writing that it plans to “make it easier for people to communicate with the businesses they want to reach on WhatsApp”, emphasis mine.
[Update: WhatsApp now confirms our hunch, telling TechCrunch “Businesses will only be able to contact people who have provided their phone number and agreed to be contacted by the business over WhatsApp.”
The company also says that the enterprise solution will initially be free but it does plan to charge businesses. Some functionality that will be offered by the Business app and enterprise solution includes the ability to create a verified profile with info like address, description, and hours, plus “Features for helping manage customer chats like away messages for when businesses are not able to respond at the moment.”]
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, the companies said they wouldn’t put ads in WhatsApp because it would degrade the experience. But it also ditched its $1 annual subscription fee, leaving few monetization options beyond charging businesses for tools. The introduction of display ads and sponsored messages to Facebook Messenger may indicate a relaxation of WhatsApp’s stance against ads.
With over 1.3 billion monthly users and 1 billion daily users, WhatsApp has reached the massive scale necessary for it to earn significant revenue even from light advertising. Its Snapchat Stories clone WhatsApp Status now has 250 million daily users, and could host vertical video ads between friends’ content the way Instagram does.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 launches with more baggage than have previous smartphones in the lineup: Its predecessor’s recall problems ended up killing the phone entirely in most markets. But the Note 8 also has a lot to live up to in the other direction, thanks to the success of the S8 and S8+, both of which boasted industry-leading design and propelled Samsung’s smartphone business to new heights.
The Note 8 is then a big device in many ways, but what it represents most of all is a maturation of the phablet form factor, or the gigantic screen phone, which the Note basically created – or at least popularized. This version of it, as I said before, seems like it takes the big display concept from outlier specialist hardware to mainstream mainstay; in practice, that’s exactly what it’s done after a week or so of testing.
I use big screen phones for practical reasons – the large displays are useful if I’m ever in a pinch and need to do some photo editing or article writing on the fly, and they’re also great for consuming content, including both text and video. But if I was picking a phone based on preferred ergonomics and design alone, I’d opt for a smaller device every time (which is why I enjoy the Essential Phone so much).

The Note 8 is the best balance out there right now between an extremely generous display size, and a device that actually fits the descriptor “mobile.” Its 6.3-inch display gives you a long, gorgeous column for easily gobbling down long sections of text, and it’s a stunning device for viewing photos or videos. Samsung’s video enhancer also works wonders here, bumping up brightness, contrast and saturation to make video content, including Netflix HDR, especially pop automatically when you use those apps or view videos on the web.
In terms of footprint, the Note 8 isn’t that far off from the iPhone 7 Plus, and is in fact narrower (though also slightly taller). It’s the same size in terms of how it feels in the pocket, however, and perhaps a bit more manageable in the hand (though reaching for that top left corner will still be a stretch).
When you add the S Pen into the mix with the Galaxy Note 8, which ships with the phone and is spring-loaded in the bottom left corner, and so always easy to access, what the Note 8 becomes is the ultimate productivity smartphone. It’s the easy choice for anyone who wants to get their work done on the go, but who generally sticks to a phone above all else, which these days includes a lot of execs and busy business travellers.

The Note 8 is also an appealing choice for creatives and artists, since the S Pen actually performs incredibly well when used with apps like Autodesk’s Sketchbook and ArtFlow, displaying impressive performance in terms of both latency and pressure sensitivity. If you’re the type of person who likes to have a pocket notebook or sketchbook handy, the Note 8 is also for you.
Combined with the camera system, which offers industry leading performance in my opinion in terms of both its artificial depth of field effects and general snappiness, the Note 8 is no longer an outlier device – it feels like the true Samsung flagship, and a vision of productivity done right in the age of mobile device dominance.",2017-09-05,1536016,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147a2040.jpg?w=738,mobile/,,Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 excels as a premium productivity smartphone,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/samsungs-galaxy-note-8-excels-as-a-premium-productivity-smartphone/
Jon Russell,Hardware,"Xiaomi’s newest flagship smartphone will launch the day before the next iPhone, but Chinese firm has offered another new arrival before that date — and it marks a departure from the usual. That’s because Xiaomi has unveiled its first device running Google’s Android One software, and it’s called the Mi A1.
The device was launched at a press event in India today and it is the first to go to market with the revamped Android One software, the program designed to bring a high-end experience to affordable smartphones. It’s also the first device to go on sale without running Xiaomi’s own MIUI software — and it is in line to get Android Oreo before the end of 2017.
That should already be enough to get your attention… and then there’s the price.
The Mi A1 is priced around the $230 mark and a wide global release is planned. Xiaomi said the phone is slated for sale in 40 countries worldwide, some of which include Indonesia, Vietnam, Russia, Poland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ukraine and Mexico. Notably, though, the U.S. and UK are not on the list.
First up, the phone will be available in India from September 12. Timing for other launches has not been communicated yet.

Beyond the Android One selling point, the 5.5-inch Mi A1 sports a dual-lens 12 megapixel rear camera and five megapixel front camera. That rear camera arrangement includes wide angle and telephoto lenses to give more advanced photography options — and, yes, the bokeh effect. It’s something we’ve seen in high-end devices like the iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Xiaomi’s own Mi 6 flagship, and that makes its inclusion pretty unique for a phone in the sub-$300 range.
He’s an interesting tidbit [hat tip Mashable], Xiaomi is for once not being shy in inviting comparisons to the iPhone. One big difference is obviously the price, with the iPhone 7 Plus costing upwards of $649.
It’s worth noting that despite being Android One, Xiaomi has opted for its own camera app over the Google alternative. A small detail, but one that prospective customers may have strong opinions on — or not.
The device is basically an international version of the Mi 5X which launched in China earlier this month. Elsewhere, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor running the show, with 4 GB RAM, 64 GB of internal storage and a 3080 mAh battery.
There’s supports for USB-C, there’s a fingerprint scanner on the reverse and it will be available in a choice of Black, Gold and Rose Gold.

All in all, this looks like an impressive Android One device.
Google has put a focus on making Android One more appealing than before — phones released since 2014 have been stuck with a ‘budget’ label — and getting Xiaomi’s brand to be a part is bound to help.
Google certainly seems pleased at the collaboration. It called the device “great example” of what the Android One program can produce.
Proof is in the pudding, of course, and we are yet to get our hands on the Mi A1 to give you some insight into how it performs in the real world. If nothing else, it will be novel to see a Xiaomi phone that doesn’t run the company’s MIUI software, which is used by over 200 million people.

Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"GetAccept co-founder Mathias Thulin is very familiar with a common problem sales representatives have: they have a great meeting with a potential customer, fire off an email to follow up on that deal and send a thank you note, and then hear nothing back.
With all these leads going dark, Thulin and his co-founder Samir Smajic wanted to dig into the data to figure out what was happening. To do that, they decided to start GetAccept, an e-signature service that helps representatives track their documents and help close those deals. The start-up today said that it has raised $1.6 million in a seed funding round from Amino Capital and Y Combinator, as well as other angel investors. GetAccept came out of Y Combinator in 2016.
“Too many times you had a great meeting that you just said, ah I love this, send me a proposal and I will talk with my manager and get back to you next week,” Thulin said. “Then, they just go dark. There are much more decision-makers involved that they tell you about, and also that it’s so hard to understand how engaged they actually are. You don’t know what’s happening after you sent the proposal. It’s so easy to ignore your inbox and phone when you try to follow-up with a sales rep.”
Internally, GetAccept analyses a sales representative’s behavior to see why they are closing on more deals, or vice versa. It looks for cues, like a sales representative including a product demo or the company connecting directly through a chat bot that then connects them directly to another representative. These sales representatives can also lean on retargeting, chasing their leads across platforms in order to build that awareness. Thulin argues that it’s all these light touches that can help companies close that deal, but often times they just go overlooked.

He also likes to say that his startup is based on artificial intelligence — though you won’t find it at the deep, complex level of a convolutional neural network. But there is certainly some learning happening in the background, with algorithms studying the behavior of the best sales people and the trick and quirks they have that are helping them close better sales leads. It’s not some kind of hardcore AI that would come out of a lab at Stanford, but this kind of self-reflecting software is a hallmark of many emerging enterprise sales startups that look to help businesses streamline their processes.
“If we could find the triggers that could help push the deal forward, we would do it,” Smajic said. “We see that it’s really for different reasons why sales reps can push the lead forward. If [potential customers] don’t open the document in 24 hours, then we definitely need to address it. We also see another case that if they forward it to other people [in the organization] that the deal will be postponed because there are people involved. We figured out we couldn’t use generic tools, and that was the reason.”
GetAccept, with this seed funding, still faces an uphill battle against e-signature companies like DocuSign and lead tracking from existing lead-tracking CRM start-ups like Gong or Attach. Those are two very significant markets, though Smajic says that by targeting a product that does both of them will help them outmaneuver the companies that look to eventually dig into each others’ territories. Getting there first will help, though it remains to be seen if they will be able to get the kind of widespread adoption that these companies have already built up.",2017-09-04,1535201,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/founders_20171.jpg?w=738,mobile/,,GetAccept raises $1.6M to help companies close sales leads faster,y-combinator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/getaccept-raises-1-6m-to-help-companies-close-sales-leads-faster/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"There’s no shortage of weather apps on the market, but you may have noticed that few of them are actually all that good. That’s where a new entry called Weather Atlas, from the developer behind the popular productivity app Launch Center Pro, comes in. This newly launched weather application aims to be a better alternative to the stock weather app, offering a more modern take on weather apps, as well as a design that’s ready for the new, taller screen expected in the upcoming iPhone 8.
According to Weather Atlas creator, David Barnard, the app includes bottom-focused navigation modeled after Apple’s Maps app, as well as a stacked maps and forecast that will take advantage of the extra space provided by the iPhone 8’s extra vertical space.
“Weather Atlas started as an update to my old weather app, Perfect Weather,” he explains. “I built Perfect Weather in 2013 because there were no apps at the time that showed a glanceable view of both the forecasts and weather maps,” Barnard continues. “Living in Texas where storms can pop up randomly or blow through from the north or south, I like to take a quick look at the radar even if there’s no rain forecasted in my immediate area.”
“In 2017 there are now a few weather apps that do show both the forecast and weather maps in the same view, but none of them do it well,” he adds.

Plus, he notes that even though the weather app market is crowded, these apps see high usage, which makes the idea to enter the space still compelling.
I have to agree that many of today’s top weather apps are starting a feel a bit dated.
Yahoo’s entry in the space years ago was then heralded as a surprisingly attractive creation with its heavy focus on visuals, but its big in-app advertisements have since limited its appeal. Meanwhile, other highly ranked apps like those from The Weather Channel, Weather Underground, AccuWeather, WeatherBug and others perform their utilitarian tasks as promised, but their designs feel a little less-than-current.
Then there’s that small matter of how AccuWeather was sending users’ location data to a third party, which recently led many users to dump the app from their iPhone. (If that’s a concern for you, Weather Atlas is a good replacement because it doesn’t require your location to work. There are ways to use it without providing access to your personal data. And if you do share location data, it’s not sold or shared with ad networks.)
At launch, the new app includes a 10-day forecast; but unlike some weather apps, this forecast also includes hourly breakdowns for all ten days – just keeping scrolling on the hourly forecast screen to see the later days.
The mapping component in the app will display radar and cloud layers, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation accumulation – layers that aren’t that aren’t as standard elsewhere.
The app also supports warning layers for things like thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tropical tracks – the latter being especially timely given how Hurricane Irma is now getting cooked up out in the Atlantic.
Plus, Weather Atlas takes advantage of another newer iOS feature, as well – it lets you choose your preferred app icon for your homescreen from a broad selection. Though support for customizable icons were launched earlier this year with iOS 10.3, it’s  still not too common these days to see apps offering this feature. Outside of MLB at Bat and NHL’s apps, we haven’t seen broad adoption from the developer community.
You can even change the weather icons within the app to match your preferred style. A Notification Center widget is included, too, if that’s where you prefer to check the forecast.
On iPad, the app leverages Apple’s latest technologies like Split View.
The app, at launch, provides most of the basics you’d need, but will be updated with support for other features in future releases like push notifications. However, the plan is not to overwhelm users’ with too much data like “some of the nerdier weather apps” do, as Barnard puts it.
The app is a free download and is ad-supported, but you can remove ads by paying a $4.99 annual subscription, or $0.49 per month.
This “Pro” subscription allows you to support the app’s maker, and gain access to other features including some of those mentioned above, like the customizable icons; warning layers on the maps; additional weather layers like Temperature, Humidity, and Precipitation Accumulation; and Hourly and Daily widgets. (The Current Conditions widget is free though.)
Subscriptions for weather apps is now a fairly common practice – The Weather Channel, for example, lets you block ads by subscription. Not everyone wants to pay, of course, which is why Weather Atlas still works well without the upgrade. (But I have to say the ads are pretty distracting…it’s worth paying to remove them.)
However, since its launch yesterday, around 7 percent of those who downloaded the app subscribed. That’s closer to 10 percent, if you only count those who launched the app and checked it out, notes Barnard.
Weather Atlas is available for the U.S. only in the App Store. Other countries may be supported in the future.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Google’s search app on iOS is adding a Trending Searches feature, similar to Twitter or Facebook’s Trends, with an update that rolled out later in the day on Thursday. According to the app’s added “What’s New” text on the App Store, Google will now show you searches that are “trending around you” when you tap into the search box to start a search. It’s also showing Instant Answers as you type, meaning you can ask questions or get quick information before you even press the search button.
If the Trending Searches feature sounds familiar, that’s because the feature was rolled out last year on Android, where it was quickly met with a huge influx of user complaints. In fact, one thread on the Google Search product forum was filled with some 500 posts from people who hated the feature and wanted to turn it off.
People had then said they found the feature annoying and distracting, especially because it wasn’t content they were personally interested in – it reflected what the masses on Google were searching. Wrote one person at the time, “I have never searched for Captain America or Manchester United football. Please disable asap.”
A few months later, Google responded to this feedback with an update that implemented an opt-out Setting in the Google Search app.

With the updated app on the App Store, it seems that Trending is again making its way to mobile users. And yes, there’s an opt-out option included.
Now, the Trending Searches have blue, rounded ‘climbing arrow’ icons next to them, which makes these trends easier to differentiate from your own search history, as compared with the gray icons on a white background when the feature first launched last year.
Though the update claims the Trends are related to what’s happening around you, they don’t seem to be all that local. Instead, today’s list points to general U.S. trends, like the upcoming iPhone event, Big Brother spoilers, and Starbucks Pumpkin Spice latté, among other things. (Wow, that’s America in a nutshell, huh?)
In addition, the search feature itself has gotten a little smarter, as it can now answer questions as you type out your search query – even if you typo.

For example, Google suggests, if you typed “goog stock” or “how tall is the Eiffel Tower,” the answer would appear in the suggestions below the search box. This data comes from Google’s Knowledge Graph – its database of facts sourced from places like Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook.
These updates follow a more recent, major change to Google’s app, which introduced “the feed,” Google’s own, algorithmically crafted news stream focused on your interests.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Microsoft’s mobile game streaming app Mixer Create is launching out of beta testing today on iOS and Android, allowing gamers to broadcast the games they’re playing right from their phone. This feature works on Android with all games, but is more limited on iOS. On iPhone, select games that have enabled Apple’s ReplayKit functionality will work, the company notes.
That means games like Star Trek Timelines, Goat Simulator, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, and others will be supported.
The app can also be used for co-streaming, which allows up to four streamers to combine their streams into a single viewing experience, Microsoft says in its announcement. In the new app, there’s now an invitations feature that’s partially functional for now. Currently, you can accept or reject the pop-up co-stream invites, but in a few months, you’ll be able to send out these co-stream invites as well.
Gamers can also use the app for non-gaming related purposes, too – like vlogging through a feature that lets them ‘go live’ at any time to initiate a real-time broadcast to their fans.
Plus, streamers can interact with viewers in their channel’s chat interface when broadcasting, as they could on PC or Xbox.
This includes access to moderation tools as well. Some gamers may choose to use the Mixer Create app for chat, while streaming from their computer or console, Microsoft suggests.
The launch comes shortly after rival Twitch debuted an updated streaming app of its own, which included the ability to live stream from mobile devices to their channels. Like Microsoft, Twitch is also working to expand beyond gaming to allow its streamers to broadcast other content, including personal updates and other artistic endeavours.
While Microsoft has some features gamers want, its traction in the streaming market still lags behind both Twitch and YouTube in terms of reach. According to a recent study by Streamlabs, Twitch has a much larger chunk of the streaming market, ahead of YouTube in second place. Microsoft, Periscope and Facebook Live had only slivers.

However, Mixer (a startup that won TechCrunch Disrupt last year, when it was then called Beam), is still a relatively new entry to this market, and could catch up in time, or at least increase its share.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"SanDisk has a new record-breaking microSD coming to market, which will deliver so much storage you might be at a loss as to what to do with it all. The new 400GB SanDisk Ultra microSDXC UHS-I card is the world’s highest capacity card of its type, and is ideally suited for use in Android smartphones that feature an expansion slot.
Android’s most recent versions allow you to adopt microSD-based storage as “native internal” storage, which allows you to use it to install apps, store photos and more as if you were using a built-in flash memory drive. Most recent Android devices that offer a microSD slot will support the new 400GB chip out of the box, meaning you can get your phone up to almost double what the top-end iPhone currently offers in onboard storage.
The SanDisk 400gb microSD card can hold up to 40 hours of 1080p HD video, Western Digital notes, and offers transfer speeds of up to 100mb/s. It’s also designed to comply with the A1 App Performance Class specification for flash memory, which means it can load and run apps faster when operating as adopted internal storage.
Even though it offers so much added storage, the price won’t break the bank – at $250, it’s actually very reasonable for in terms of price to storage ratio. It also comes with a 10-year limited manufacturer’s warranty, and should be available soon via SanDisk directly and all the usual retail suspects.

Anthony Ha,Entertainment,"Disruptor Beam has already created games based on Star Trek and Game of Thrones. Next up is The Walking Dead, with the launch of The Walking Dead: March to War.
To build the game, which was first announced last year, the company partnered with Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment. That means the game is technically an adaptation of the comics, but the environments and challenges should feel pretty familiar to TV fans, too.
Not that this is the first mobile game to adapt the ubiquitous zombie franchise — Telltale has released multiple, critically acclaimed Walking Dead adventure titles, while Scopely’s got The Walking Dead: Road to Survival.
Still, I was quite impressed by what Disruptor Beam CEO Jon Radoff demonstrated for me. March to War takes place in the same zombie-overrun United States as the comics — in this case, Washington, D.C.
The team created what Radoff said is a 20-square-mile map of the city. In other words, it’s a big map, but it also has lots of detail, allowing you to recognize landmarks like the White House, and even to spot individual walkers (a.k.a. zombies) moving across the landscape.

You can also interact with characters from the comics like Rick and Negan by adding them to your council, where they’ll advise you on your next move.
And as in the comics, the walkers provide a threat, but the bigger danger comes from other humans. March to War is a multiplayer experience that allows you to form alliances with other players (you’ll have a pretty tough time trying to survive on your own, Radoff said), and then launch raids and attacks on other communities.
The Walking Dead: March to War is available for free on iOS and Android. Radoff said the launch reflects the same philosophy that Disruptor Beam used with Game of Thrones Ascent and Star Trek Timelines — the goal is to win over the most passionate fans of the franchise, and then expand outward from there.
Radoff said this is also happening as the owners of popular entertainment franchises increasingly see games as a way to stay connected to fans, not just to make a quick buck.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Garmin has three new wearable devices it’s debuting at IFA 2017, including the vivosport GPS-enabled activity tracker, the vivomove HR hybrid touchscreen smartwatch and the vivoactive 3, a smartwatch with Garmin Pay, which supports Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards to enable mobile payments on the go.
The Garmin vivoactive 3 includes GPS, a heart rate monitor, and battery life of 7 days in smartwatch mode, and 13 hours if you’re using constant GPS tracking. It comes in three different colors, and supports both built-in sports apps for up to 15 different activities, as well as additional user-customizable activity apps. The vivoactive can keep track of stress levels over time thanks to heart rate variability monitoring, and additional watch faces, apps and more are available in the Garmin Connect IQ store, which is accessible via the companion smartphone app.

Garmin’s vivoactive 3 also features the Garmin Chroma display, which pairs sunlight readable transflective screen tech with backlighting for visibility at night, too. The standout feature, however, is the new Garmin Pay support, which allows for contactless payments via Visa and MasterCard cards from a range of major U.S. banks. Garmin Pay is powered by FitPay, which is a platform designed specifically to help bring mobile payments to mobile and IoT devices, without requiring direct, separate negotiations with the banks and issuers.
The vivomove HR is Garmin’s first hybrid touchscreen smartwatch, which means it blends a traditional analog watchface with a built-in digital sub-display. The watch offers much more subtle styling vs full-digital screen devices, but still can display notifications from your smartphone, as well as activity data and heart rate. It comes with both leather and silicone strap options, and different case materials including a higher end stainless steel finish.

Vivomove HR can also monitor stress throughout the day, and works with the Garmin Connect Mobile app. It retails for $199.99, and $299.99 for the upgraded version.
Finally, the vivosport is a smart activity tracker, focused more on fitness functions, but offering up to 7 days in smartwatch mode and up to eight hours in GPS mode. It’s got a slim deign focused on lightweight wearability, and uses that always-on power efficient Garmin Chroma color touchscreen tech for its display.

Built-in apps will track walking, running, biking, cardio and strength training, and the Garmin Move IQ feature will automatically categorize and record lots of activity in case you forget. There are also notifications via vibration included from your smartphone, as well as remote control for a Garmin VIRB action camera if you happen to have one of those.

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Launching a product and company from scratch is hard, as fresh-faced entrepreneurs and Kickstarter successes often learn to their chagrin. And it turns out even heavy hitters like Andy Rubin and his mobile startup Essential have unpleasant lessons to learn — in this case, about how even a small detail like a mailing list configuration can put your entire company at risk.
The error appeared earlier this week as some customers were asked to send a photo ID to Essential to complete their orders. When they did, that information was inexplicably forwarded to the whole list of customers, about 70 of them, who had been asked to do so in the first place.
	
The problem was resolved, but for a young company purporting to fix a lot of the problems in today’s mobile and tech landscape, such an amateur error is hardly an auspicious beginning. What are we to think about their attention to detail in other important areas?
Rubin decided to address this potential crisis of confidence with a post on the Essential blog.
After a bit of preamble in which he established how hard it is to be Andy Rubin, a founder who must make “thousands of micro-decisions” to keep the company “laser-focused” he got around to the apology part:
He then returns to what it’s like to be a founder — although this time it’s to say that “occasionally you have to eat crow. It’s humiliating, it doesn’t taste good, and often, it’s a humbling experience.”
But not always!

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Amazon appears to be planning an expansion of Alexa’s existing messaging capabilities to support sending SMS text messages to friends using your Echo device or Alexa app. That means Echo users could then text anyone using voice commands, not only other Echo owners.
According to code found in the Amazon Alexa app, there are references to a new type of phone number – referred to as your “Alexa number” – which is listed alongside other contact information, like a home phone number, work phone, and mobile. Additionally, references in the code specifically state that users will be able to “send and receive SMS text messages” from their Echo device or the Alexa app.
News of SMS messaging was first spotted by the site Voicebot.ai, citing an unnamed source.
In a screenshot of code they’ve now added to their original report from last week, you can see lines that reference this so-called “Alexa number,” and further details about how this feature works.

Image credit: Voicebot.ai
For example, the code includes references like “My Alexa number is:” and “When you send messages, your contacts will receive them from this number.” 
It also says “Send and receive SMS text messages using Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, and the Alexa app,” and offers an example of how to use the feature.
It says you can use voice commands like “Alexa, message Jane” and another to check the messages you’ve received. (These commands work today, but don’t extend to SMS.)
Assuming this is something in active development, rather than placeholder code of some kind, this new feature would go beyond the existing Alexa calling and messaging options that launched in May.
Currently, Echo owners can place free voice calls and send text messages using a supported Echo device or the Alexa companion app on their smartphone. However, this feature is limited because the only people you can call or text are those who also have the Alexa app and an Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show.

Today, for instance, you can tell Alexa to “message Jane,” but Jane won’t get an SMS text from you, in that case. She has to read it in her Alexa app, or ask Echo to check her messages. If the code above actually does what it promises, then that would change when this feature goes live. Jane would then get a SMS text sent from your “Alexa number.”
At present, the existing messaging feature requires you upload your phone contacts to your Alexa app to get started. This led to some privacy issues at launch – users could message you, call or send voice messages to you as long as they had your phone number and the Alexa app installed.
Amazon, in a response to backlash about this problem, rolled out a contact blocking setting shortly after the feature debuted.

Above: Amazon’s website detailing the feature as it works today
An “Alexa number” could come into play here as another means of protecting user privacy.
You could give out your “Alexa number” to those you want to be able text or call you through Echo and the Alexa platform, when you don’t feel comfortable enough to give them your “real” phone number.
Then you could use Alexa voice commands to send actual SMS texts to those recipients, or you could type your texts in the Alexa app.
This is a similar value proposition offered by competing voice services, like Google Voice or Skype, for example, as well as apps that offer you temporary and virtual phone numbers, like Burner.
Beyond the screenshot from Voicebot’s report above, there are other references to this “Alexa number” that can be found in the Alexa Android app (the APK file)’s code.

Above and below: code showing an “Alexa” phone number type

Here, you’ll see this “Alexa number” is listed as one of the phone number types a user can have on file in addition to others, like a home phone, work phone, mobile, and “other” – all standard contact fields. The Alexa number field in this APK contains an actual phone number with an area code, which hints that Amazon may assign a virtual number to Echo owners.
Amazon already has a solution to do this, Voicebot had pointed out – AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS) is often used by businesses who want to send broadcast SMS messages to their customers, among other things.
Another interesting tidbit is that a reference in the code (see the first image) also says that “Messaging is available for free for a limited time.”  
That could mean that being able to send SMS texts is something Amazon is considering rolling out as a paid upgrade. That would be notable, if true, as Amazon isn’t really monetizing Echo right now beyond the cost of selling the hardware itself, and from those consumers who use its voice shopping features.
Of course, finding code references doesn’t always mean that a feature is in active development or on the near-term roadmap. But there’s quite a lot of code here to dismiss this as being placeholder text, written “just in case” Amazon’s decides to go that route.
In addition, it seems clear that Amazon is highly interested in the potential for Echo to become a communication device. It launched the Echo Show, which has a disruptive new way to stay in touch called “Drop In,” where you literally just pop up on a friend or family member’s video screen.
Plus, the Alexa app today defaults to the “Conversations” screen, instead of the app’s actual “Home” screen – something meant to encourage adoption of the messaging service.
Reached for comment about Alexa’s planned SMS texting feature, an Amazon spokesperson only said “per company policy, we don’t comment on rumors or speculation.”

Romain Dillet,Apps,"Apple is pushing the limits of its beta program as the company just released the tenth beta version of iOS 11. If you have a developer account and want to try out the next version of iOS, you can download the new beta version right now.
iOS 11 is the next major release of the operating system for the iPhone and iPad. Apple first unveiled iOS 11 at its WWDC event back in June 2017. Developers and early adopters have been able to try out the new version for three months.
And the wait is almost over as Apple should release iOS 11 a week after the new iPhone event on September 12. Existing iPhone and iPad owners will be able to update for free.
At this point, beta versions of iOS 11 feel quite stable. I wouldn’t recommend installing iOS 11 on the iPhone you use every day — beta versions of iOS usually drain your battery life. But if you have an iPad and are feeling adventurous, you can install it right now.
If you have a developer account and pay $99 per year to access new betas, developer tools and content, you can download iOS 11 beta 10 on Apple’s developer website. If you don’t want to pay $99, Apple now has a public beta program.
The iPad is going to receive the biggest changes in iOS 11. The update turns your iPad into a more capable tablet as you can drag and drop files, app icons and more across the operating system. There’s a system-wide dock, a new app switcher and a Files app so you can launch apps and manage your documents more easily.
If you don’t have an iPad, most of the changes are under the hood, starting with Apple’s augmented reality framework ARKit. Many developers have been working on ARKit-enabled apps, but they’re not in the App Store just yet. There’s also a completely redesigned Control Center with customizable shortcuts. I wrote a preview of the upcoming changes in iOS 11 if you want to learn more.",2017-09-06,1536757,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ios-11-preview-5.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"ios-11,ios",Apple just released iOS 11 beta 10 to developers,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/apple-just-released-ios-11-beta-10-to-developers/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Microsoft will host an event in London at the end of October and beginning of November, the latest in its annual ‘Future Decoded’ series. The event will also feature a Surface-focused keynote, The Verge reports, at which it will unveil at least one new hardware device.
The most recent update to the Surface line was the new Surface Pro, the fifth generation of Microsoft’s tablet convertible, which was released in June. At the time, Microsoft also announced that a version of the Surface Pro with a built-in LTE connection would be coming later, so it seems likely that this device will get a debut at this October event.
But there could be more in store, too: The Surface Book hasn’t had an update since last year, so it stands to reason that the notebook/tablet performance-focused hybrid might get a refresh. The Verge says we might also see an update to the Surface Hub, its large business-focused interactive display.
Microsoft’s latest Surface Pro features enhanced performance with the Microsoft Pen stylus, and an update to the Surface Book line to support those features would likely be welcomed by its fans. Microsoft also previously said support for on-screen use of its Surface Dial would be coming to the Surface Book and Surface Pro line, so that’s another possibility.

Devin Coldewey,Augmented Reality,"For someone getting major dental work or reconstructive surgery, it can be hard to visualize what they’ll look like afterwards. You can do casts and make wax molds, but that’s a bit… 19th century, isn’t it? A Swiss startup brings the, in retrospect, obvious solution of augmented reality to the problem, giving patients a virtual view of the smile they could soon have.
The company, Kapanu, is a spin-off of Swiss technical university ETH Zurich; CEO Roland Mörzinger and his team created an augmented reality engine for medical purposes, and dentistry was chosen as a good first application. (Disney Research was involved with early research at ETHZ but not, as I had written here before, with Kapanu’s final project.)
It works by matching a 3D scan of the person’s mouth cavity (a procedure many dentists do already) to scans of known sets of good teeth already used for this kind of thing. Once the software locks onto the user’s mouth and teeth, it overlays the improved teeth — and that’s where the fun starts. There are options the user can then tweak: how close the teeth are, various shapes and spacing and so on. All the changes are visible live.

Once the patient has customized their teeth and given them a preview in the AR “virtual mirror,” the final model is sent off for manufacture wherever it is replacement teeth are made.
The system was shown at the International Dental Show in Cologne last winter, and apparently they were mobbed. It clearly impressed the big players in this corner of the health world: this June Kapanu was acquired by Ivoclar Vivadent. No word on the terms, but the company is operating independently.
It’s a nice success story for augmented reality, which often is relegated to applications that are little more than toys. A real business with everyday applications that tangibly benefit people — imagine that!",2017-09-05,1536468,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/smile.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"eth-zurich,dentistry","Smile, you’re in augmented reality dentistry",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/smile-youre-in-augmented-reality-dentistry/

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 launches with more baggage than have previous smartphones in the lineup: Its predecessor’s recall problems ended up killing the phone entirely in most markets. But the Note 8 also has a lot to live up to in the other direction, thanks to the success of the S8 and S8+, both of which boasted industry-leading design and propelled Samsung’s smartphone business to new heights.
The Note 8 is then a big device in many ways, but what it represents most of all is a maturation of the phablet form factor, or the gigantic screen phone, which the Note basically created – or at least popularized. This version of it, as I said before, seems like it takes the big display concept from outlier specialist hardware to mainstream mainstay; in practice, that’s exactly what it’s done after a week or so of testing.
I use big screen phones for practical reasons – the large displays are useful if I’m ever in a pinch and need to do some photo editing or article writing on the fly, and they’re also great for consuming content, including both text and video. But if I was picking a phone based on preferred ergonomics and design alone, I’d opt for a smaller device every time (which is why I enjoy the Essential Phone so much).

The Note 8 is the best balance out there right now between an extremely generous display size, and a device that actually fits the descriptor “mobile.” Its 6.3-inch display gives you a long, gorgeous column for easily gobbling down long sections of text, and it’s a stunning device for viewing photos or videos. Samsung’s video enhancer also works wonders here, bumping up brightness, contrast and saturation to make video content, including Netflix HDR, especially pop automatically when you use those apps or view videos on the web.
In terms of footprint, the Note 8 isn’t that far off from the iPhone 7 Plus, and is in fact narrower (though also slightly taller). It’s the same size in terms of how it feels in the pocket, however, and perhaps a bit more manageable in the hand (though reaching for that top left corner will still be a stretch).
When you add the S Pen into the mix with the Galaxy Note 8, which ships with the phone and is spring-loaded in the bottom left corner, and so always easy to access, what the Note 8 becomes is the ultimate productivity smartphone. It’s the easy choice for anyone who wants to get their work done on the go, but who generally sticks to a phone above all else, which these days includes a lot of execs and busy business travellers.

The Note 8 is also an appealing choice for creatives and artists, since the S Pen actually performs incredibly well when used with apps like Autodesk’s Sketchbook and ArtFlow, displaying impressive performance in terms of both latency and pressure sensitivity. If you’re the type of person who likes to have a pocket notebook or sketchbook handy, the Note 8 is also for you.
Combined with the camera system, which offers industry leading performance in my opinion in terms of both its artificial depth of field effects and general snappiness, the Note 8 is no longer an outlier device – it feels like the true Samsung flagship, and a vision of productivity done right in the age of mobile device dominance.",2017-09-05,1536016,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147a2040.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,,Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 excels as a premium productivity smartphone,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/samsungs-galaxy-note-8-excels-as-a-premium-productivity-smartphone/
John Biggs,Gadgets,"You’ve seen it all before: a drone takes off in an open field, everything is clear. The drone flies straight up for a moment then, on the way down, it hits a tree. A moment later the whole thing is a mess. Plastic everywhere, the motors whizzing and failing, a camera flinging off and into the bushes. Disaster!
But what if you could easily take that broken drone, fry it, and dip it into some fresh-made guacamole or queso? Now that’s something I can get behind.
Peter Sripol, a maker in Ohio, has done just that. He used tortillas as a structural element for an RC glider and ran a number of tests, rolling, pinning, and gluing the tortillas together until he got his glider to fly. Why? Because tortillas are delicious.

Sarah Buhr,eCommerce,"You can’t walk outside your door in San Francisco these days without seeing some tech worker or VC wearing a pair of Allbirds. The eco-friendly wool shoes have taken over the tech world since the startup’s launch a mere 18 months ago. Now, it plans to expand globally and develop new materials beyond its signature merino wool.
Allbirds has a good amount of capital to go there as the company just raised $17.5 million for its Series B funding, adding a total of $27.5 million to work with now.
Tiger Global Management led the round and, as you may be able to tell from the hedge fund’s other bets, Allbirds intends to use those connections to spread its wings internationally.
Tiger Global has its fingers in several Asian countries, with affiliates in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangalore and Melbourne, places where co-founder Tim Brown would like to start selling the product.
Other participants in the round include Elephant, and existing investors Maveron and Lerer Hippeau.

The sustainable shoe startup has also set its sights on research into more environmentally friendly materials to expand the product line. Allbirds currently manufactures the product in South Korea, with material sourcing coming from what I’m told is the same mill Armani uses in Italy to make its wool suits.
Brown played it coy when asked which new materials he was looking at but did add that, as great as he thought wool was, it had its limits.
“We’re focused on the idea of comfort and comfort is different when it’s raining, when it’s snowing. Comfort is different when it’s 110 degrees and you’re wearing wool,” Brown told TechCrunch. “Wool is a miracle material but there’s other materials that do other things.”
The startup is also planning to push into physical retail. Allbird’s current model is direct-to-consumer, selling shoes from its website. But, much like Tiger Global’s other bet, Warby Parker, the plan is to expand into brick-and-mortar.
Allbirds already started the physical process, selling out of its first retail location in a 500-square-foot downtown San Francisco retail space it calls “Allbirds on Hotaling.” It now plans to scout for a second store location in a yet-to-be-announced city.
A company spokesperson couldn’t give me the foot traffic or sales for San Francisco store but did say it was “doing better than expected.”
Allbirds, which come in several styles and colors for both men and women and sell for $95 a pair, aims to replicate the success elsewhere. A good next bet would be Los Angeles or New York if it plans to follow in the footsteps of other direct-to-consumer turned physical retail models.
Brown declined to disclose revenue numbers but did say the startup was doing well enough it has seen copycats — the ultimate compliment in retail branding.",2017-09-05,1535560,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/allbirds_women_naturalwhite.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"san-francisco,tiger-global-management,allbirds",Allbirds plans to expand to new materials with $17.5 million in fresh funds,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/allbirds-plans-to-expand-to-new-materials-with-17-5-million-in-fresh-funds/
Matt Burns,Gadgets,"I use a Hobonichi Techo Weeks as a daily planner. Like John found when reviewing planners, it’s the perfect size and has just enough space for my to-do list, appointments and a bit of journaling. But it doesn’t sync to my Google Calendar like Moleskine’s upcoming planner. I mean, my planner is just normal paper. The Moleskine version is a combination of a smart pen and special paper.
This is the latest product in Moleskine’s Smart Writing Set but the first to feature calendar syncing. Previous products would sync hand-written notes using either a smartphone’s camera or a Neo pen.

Meetings and appointments written on the planner part of the paper are synced automatically to the user’s Google or Apple account and placed appropriately on their calendar.
Both the pen and the paper are required for this system to work.
The system will be available worldwide on September 12 though at a much higher price than my Hobonichi planner. The set will cost $199 or $29 for just the planner.
There are a handful of smart writing systems on the market including Livescribe’s own line of products, but few, if any, offer direct calendar syncing. That’s the key here.

Matt Burns,Gadgets,"Remember the Lily drone? It was the drone a person could launch by throwing it in the air and then it would follow the user gallivanting around Dolores Park. It was also the company that couldn’t live up to its crowdfunding campaign and ultimately shut down last January. It’s now available. Sort of.
It’s called the Lily Next-Gen and looks much like the original with a blue and black paint scheme and a smiling face around the camera. But that’s about it. This drone is not the Lily drone originally promised. This is the Lily name slapped onto another drone.
The Lily branding rights were sold to the Mota Group for $300,000 in January. Another company, LR Acquisitions, bought the company’s patents and 70 prototypes of the un-launched Lily drone. Forbes reported at the time GoPro even bid $250,000 on the intellectual property.
Mota relaunched Lily’s original website at lily.camera and is positioning this drone as the successor to the original. This new drone has features current buyers expect: 4k video, foldable design and “follow-me” functions.
But things are still missing promised to the original drone. The Lily Next-Gen is not waterproof nor does it have a wrist mounted controller. The drone cannot be launched by tossing it in the air. This is a branding play though at this point the LIly brand is rather toxic.
The original Lily sold $34 million worth of pre-ordered Lily drones and failed to produce a viable product. No one got a drone. All the money was lost. And now Mota Group wants to sell an inferior product with the toxic name.

Alex Wilhelm,Gadgets,"

In a pleasant Friday surprise, Roku dropped its S-1 document today, detailing its financial performance and corporate strategy.
The filing indicates that the company intends to raise $100 million in its debut. The figure is a widely-recognized placeholder number. The company could raise more or less in its IPO.
Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook
As a private company, Roku raised more than $200 million.
The firm, whose IPO was widely anticipated at a valuation around $1 billion, is set to test the market’s waters when indices trade near record highs, video reigns supreme in the media landscape, and some tech offerings have done well. Others have struggled.
Before the weekend impends, let’s slice through how Roku makes money, how much money it makes, and what to make of it all.
Roku sells TV-focused streaming hardware to consumers, and it also works with content players to get their material in front of consumers. It also has an ad business. The latter two efforts fall under what Roku calls “platform revenue.”
The company’s mix of top-line sources is described in its S-1 in the following fashion:
Over time, Roku has increased the percent of its total revenue that comes from its platform business. In practice, it looks like this (via Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research):

As we’ll see shortly, the mix shift in Roku’s revenue matters as one of the two sources has a far higher gross margin.
Driving the change, it seems, is that Roku drives more usage of its streaming service through partnered-hardware (TVs that run its software) instead of selling hardware over time. This means it can still drive new, active users and engaged hours while not being beholden to selling low-margin hardware.:


 
So Roku sells hardware for its streaming service, partners with TV manufacturers to sell Rock-powered hardware, drives revenue from partnered streaming companies, and sells ads.
Simple enough, really. How big is Roku? Let’s find out.
Before we dive into the guts of the company, here are the big numbers.
The following chart from Roku’s S-1 shows its 2016 and 2015 fiscal years, and the results of the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016 (calendar). Bear in mind that everything is in units of thousands, so a result of “$119,116” means $119,116,000. Let’s go:

The company’s revenue is expanding while its net losses fall thus far in 2017. The firm’s growth in the 2017 fiscal year came with slightly increased losses.
Roku grew 23 percent in the first two quarters of calendar 2017 compared to the year-ago period. That’s partially due to the company changing up how it brings in revenue. As such, the soft 23 percent figure is more nuanced than it might seem.
The above-mentioned revenue mix shift makes Roku’s revenue a bit harder to track than it otherwise might be. The firm posted sequential-quarter declines in hardware sales, for example, from the first quarter of this to the second. And, in the second quarter, the firm also posted year-over-year declines in hardware income.
Suffice it to say that the company’s hardware business is in decline. Its platform revenue has grown consistently, however. Going back a few quarters (calendar), here are its results:

As you can see, that is steady revenue growth from Roku’s platform business, aside from the slight Q4 to Q1 dip. Holiday quarters for companies that sell advertisements often see a decline in certain incomes after the close of the holiday-focused fourth quarter. The decline for Roku was modest and quickly offset by growth in the second quarter.
How investors will read that remains to be seen, but the firm has shown dramatic growth of its platform revenue—nearly 100 percent year-over-year.
More broadly, in the quarter ending June 30, 2017, Roku put up $99.62 million in revenue, less than its $100.09 million derived from its first quarter and under its fourth quarter result of $147.34 million. The company, despite its sequential-quarter declines, grew compared to its year-ago periods in each of the last four quarters.
If investors are willing to give more credence to Roku’s growing platform incomes as indicative of its corporate future, the sequential declines may not matter.
And why might investors care a bit more about Roku’s platform revenue than its hardware incomes? Because the company generates the vast bulk of its gross margin from its platform revenue. Turning once again to Dawson of Jackdaw, the following chart shows precisely how the platform business is more gross profit than the hardware business for Roku:

That’s sharp. What should we make of the above?
Roku must want out of the hardware business, at least as a leading revenue driver. It makes no money in that game. Notably, that makes it in a future-sense a nearly all-in OTT service that doesn’t generate its own content.
That isn’t a model that I would not have thought possible given the incredibly stiff arena of competition for content on the Internet today. Facebook is getting into a game that Netflix is pouring cash into, Amazon is playing, Apple is tinkering in the space, and Microsoft already picked up and dropped its video efforts.
I wonder if that fact might help Roku. It has distribution and content providers want access to audiences. That confluence could be, in part, why Roku’s ARPU is doing this:

That bodes well for the firm that, as we saw before, has a history of active user accretion. Quickly growing high-margin businesses are worth something after all.
What Roku is worth, however, is beyond me. With one revenue stream in decline, persistent losses, but big potential, the firm is going to be a fun one to price.

Matt Burns,Gadgets,"Roku has filed for an initial public offering and is looking to raise up to $100 million. The company will be listed on the NASDAQ appropriately under the ticker of ROKU.
We reported in July that Roku was planning an IPO in 2017. Roku has been able to capitalize on the cord-cutting trend, where many people, especially millennials, have opted not to pay for cable television. Instead, they are accessing content on digital platforms like Roku, Apple TV, Google’s Chromecast, Amazon’s Fire TV and others. Roku is the No. 1 streaming device when measured by total hours streamed.
This has been a long time coming. Roku was founded in 2002 and raised over $200 million from various VCs and investment firms. The company was key in helping create the home streaming device market. It was one of the first devices to target general users rather than the technically savvy. Roku never left that demographic.
Today the company claims to have 15.1 million accounts and stream quarterly 3.5 billion hours of content, which is up 60 percent year-over-year.
Menlo Ventures looks to be the largest shareholder with a 35.3 percent stake, followed by Fidelity with 12.9 percent, Twenty-First Century Fox at 7 percent and Globespan Capital Partners at 6.1 percent.
Roku states its average revenue per unit is $11.22, up 35 percent. It reported $199 million in revenue in the six month period ending June 30, 2017, up from the year prior of $162 million. Its annual revenue numbers also increased year-over-year, up from $319 million to $398 million.
The company’s primary gross profit source is switching from hardware sales to its platform, mainly around advertising and subscription revenue. In January 2017, hardware sales represented 19 percent of total gross profit while down 28 percent. Meanwhile, the platform gross profit represented 81 percent of the total, up 104 percent from the six months prior.
Roku is looking to go public at the same time as two other hardware startups-turned public companies are struggling. GoPro and Fitbit flipped the switch in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and after a brief pop, both company’s stock crashed and have yet to recover. Clearly Roku is looking for a different outcome.

Katie Roof,Food,"It sounds like America’s favorite $400 juice machine will be no longer.
“After selling over a million Produce Packs, we must let you know that we are suspending the sale of the Juicero Press and Produce Packs immediately,” reads the company blog post.
Juicero will also be giving people money back. “For the next 90 days, we are offering refunds for your purchase of the Juicero Press,” according to the note.
Founded by Doug Evans, San Francisco-based Juicero had raised more than $118 million in funding from prominent VCs like Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Carmelo Anthony also invested through his Melo7 Tech venture fund. Even The Campbell Soup Company threw money at it. Juicero started raising funding in 2013 and launched 16 months ago.
The company was subject to mockery, particularly after a Bloomberg piece showed that the juice packets could be squeezed by hand and did not require a fancy machine. 
After that, Juicero promised to lower prices, but apparently found that to be too difficult. Now the startup is hoping to find a buyer.
“We are confident that to truly have the long-term impact we want to make, we need to focus on finding an acquirer with an existing national fresh food supply chain who can carry forward the Juicero mission,” reads the blog post.
Inspired by the popularity of Keurig coffee cups, some venture investors have been looking for other kitchen appliances that could gain significant traction. “Juicing” is very popular in some parts of the United States, and the idea was that this would make it easier for people to make juice at home. But the upfront cost of the machine was high and people had to pay an added cost for the refillable packets.
Unfortunately, the machine, which was once priced at $700, was met with derision from the get-go. It became symbolic of Silicon Valley’s out-of-touch elites.
I tried the juices and can confirm they were tasty.

Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Bragi’s completely wireless earbuds, the Dash Pro (and the older Dash), will get access to Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant via a software update coming in October. This is the first time Alexa has been available on a totally wireless set of headphones, and could make The Dash even more appealing – they’re already my top pick in the wireless Bluetooth earbud category.
The addition of Alexa to the Dash Pro means that you can use Alexa Skills to do a lot directly from the buds via voice commands, including re-order your stored favorite Starbucks beverage, call an Uber, stream music from Amazon’s own streaming music service, add reminders and grocery list items and even control your smart home.
The update will be rolling out in October, as mentioned, will require a Bragi app update and connection to an Amazon account. Alexa will work with US and UK English, as well as German language support.
Bragi’s headphones have built-in mics and already work with virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant built into the devices they connect to, but Alexa’s Skill list should make them a lot more flexible in terms of translating voice commands into action.
The Bragi Dash Pro is the latest model from the company, and they’re still my top pick for wireless earbuds, because of their smart features, long battery life, good audio quality and low-profile design.",2017-09-01,1535018,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bragistarkey_dashprotailored_01.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"amazon-alexa,bragi",Bragi’s Dash and Dash Pro wireless earbuds to get Amazon Alexa,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/bragis-dash-and-dash-pro-wireless-earbuds-to-get-amazon-alexa/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Essential has a unique port around back on its debut Phone, which can handle data and power transfer, and which attaches to accessories via magnets. The first such accessory is Essential’s own 360 camera, which offers you an easy way to capture immersive images and video in a very small package. The Essential 360 camera is much smaller than most other consumer 360 cameras out there, and aims to be something that’s as easy to take with you wherever you go as the phone itself.
I got a chance to take the 360 camera for a spin over the past few days, now that it’s preparing to ship out to early Essential customers. The diminutive camera easily slides into a pocket or bag, and snaps into place on the back of the Essential phone with a satisfying click. The magnetic force also feels strong enough that you can be confident the camera won’t fall off during use, while also keeping the accessory easy enough to remove when you want to.
Snapping the camera on to the back of the Essential Phone results in the camera app itself launching right into 360-degree capture mode. This was a bit hit or miss for me – the camera app also launched, but sometimes I’d have to exit and relaunch to get the image preview to appear. Removing the camera also automatically quits the app, which is a nice feature.
By default, the app launches in photo capture mode, where you tap the virtual shutter button to grab a still. You can also pan around the image in live preview using your finger to see what the whole scene looks like. Essential stitches the image on the fly, so what you see is what you get when you tap the shutter.

Tapping the red dot next to the shutter will jump right into video recording, so that’s always only one tap away, too. Video capture also lets you pan around to see your surroundings, and again stitches the images from its two 210-degree cameras live to provide you with a real-time preview of what you’re recording.
Both the resulting images and the resulting video are good quality, and perfectly usable for sharing on Facebook and YouTube, as you can see with the examples provided. Stills come in at 12 MP, and the video records at 4K UHD resolution – 3840 x 1920, captured at 30 fps. Audio is recorded from the microphone on the camera, too, not the one on the phone, and that features a 4-mic array that captures 3D audio for more immersive effect.

In the end, Essential’s $50 camera add on is as good, or better, than some third-party mobile 360 camera options that are bulkier and more expensive. Also, this doesn’t really impact any of the video or photo results, but the Essential phone has a tiny fan in it to help with heat management, which I just find incredibly cool. Plus, it satisfies that most important quality for a camera: it’s more likely to be with you and usable, which is the key to making this kind of media more commonplace.
