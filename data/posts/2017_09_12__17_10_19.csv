Romain Dillet,Entertainment,"French startup Soundcharts is building a sort of App Annie for music artists. This service gives you a ton of data about what’s playing on the radio around the world, what’s popular in Spotify playlists and more. The company just raised $3.1 million  (€2.65M) from Alven Capital, as well as Kima Ventures and Global Founders Capital.
Many big music labels already work with companies to get insights about radio airplay. They pay a ton of money to Nielsen to access this data for instance.
Soundcharts wants to level the playing field and add more data. Many people don’t tune into the radio to find new music. They subscribe to popular playlists on Spotify, they follow artists on Facebook and more. If you want to stay ahead of the game, airtime is not enough, at least not anymore.
“We want to be the Bloomberg Finance of music,” founder and CEO David Weiszfeld told me. “Or like what App Annie is doing for apps.”
Soundcharts has servers around the world listening to hundreds of radios at the same time. These servers are using music recognition technology like Shazam to turn an audio signal into structured data.
This way, you can browse by country, by station, by artist or by song and see who is playing what. You can compare your artists with your competitors, you can find out what’s popular and more. It’s also a good tool for festival programmers.
Soundcharts is also using Spotify’s API to index all public playlists and track changes. This way, when a Chvrches song is added to an official Spotify playlist, you can see it in Soundcharts. And if you’re looking for common trends, the service also tracks playlist growth. You’ll be the first to know if dubstep is making a comeback.
Finally, Soundcharts tracks Facebook likes, gives you a breakdown by country and tells you about growth. There are many social media analytics services out there, but it’s a nice way to make Soundcharts a one stop shop. Everybody can access all data, so it’s not limited to your own artists.
So far, 250 companies have signed up, including employees working for Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music, as well as independent labels, publishers and management companies. Those companies pay a recurring subscription to access Soundcharts.",2017-09-12,1539262,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/shutterstock_178918328.jpg?w=738,europe/,france-newsletter,Soundcharts is an analytics tools for music artists and labels,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/soundcharts-is-an-analytics-tools-for-music-artists-and-labels/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Marketplace banking — the idea that your bank will provide you with access to various third-party money-related apps and services within its own app — has long been championed by fintech startups, whilst upcoming Open Banking/PSD2 legislation in the U.K. and EU, respectively, will make third-party app integration an inevitable reality. That’s seeing a number of challenger banks skating to where the puck is going, including London-based Starling Bank, which today is launching the Starling Marketplace.
Billed by the digital-only challenger bank as a new concept in banking, the Starling Marketplace puts products from other fintech providers (and in the future “lifestyle products,” because nearly every business is going to be tempted to jump onboard the Open Banking train) within “an easily browsed ecosystem” accessible within the Starling app.
Partnering companies integrate with Starling Bank via the challenger bank’s Open Banking-compliant APIs, although, as I’ll explain below, are integrating more deeply than simply making use of those APIs, which any third-party developer, once vetted, can potentially do.
The first fintech company to be added to the Starling Marketplace, and an example of the deepest kind of integration we are likely to see, is Flux, the itemised receipt and rewards startup based in London. Founded by Tom Reay, Matty Cusden-Ross, and Veronique Barbosa, all former early employees at Revolut, the company has built a software platform that bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app.
The Starling integration sees Flux send real-time itemised receipts to the Starling app when a customer pays with their Starling card at any of Flux’s retail partners, which so far includes all 111 EAT stores in the U.K. and Bel-Air. As early as next week, Flux will also enable Starling users to get automated loyalty points with cash-back for Flux-supported purchases, without the need for paper coupons. Starling Bank users will need to activate Flux from the Marketplace section of the Starling app to instantly link their card.
“This is our first native integration, where you can switch on Flux from in app, and our first full bank partnership,” Flux’s Cusden-Ross tells TechCrunch. “Starling customers should switch on Flux because we’ll help them finally rid their wallets of paper receipts and paper loyalty cards without asking them to download or setup anything extra. We also think Starling customers are particularly interested in tracking their financial life in real-time and would agree it’s insane that today the only way to keep track of exactly what we buy is via little bits of paper”.
The framing of Starling’s Flux integration as a “first full bank partnership” refers to the fact that Flux originally launched with rival challenger bank Monzo, but only in a very limited pilot that restricts the number of users that can be activated as Monzo readies its own API and marketplace banking offer.
“The users we do have have been really positive on the experience and have been driving our word of mouth sign-ups to sky-rocket, they’re all patiently on a waitlist and we’re working with Monzo to understand timelines for next steps. The on-boarding experience for Monzo is also a pilot version where the user is currently on-boarding through our website and not natively in Monzo,” explains Cusden-Ross.
In a call with Megan Caywood, Chief Platform Officer at Starling Bank, she explained that the Flux partnership, when/if Starling users choose to activate the functionality, enables a greater detail of spending data to be displayed within the Starling app for purchases made at merchants that support Flux. By default, Starling users can see the retailer’s name, amount spent, date and location (complete with a map), but Flux goes further by displaying the item bought, VAT and any available loyalty stamps.
Zooming out a bit further, Caywood says that Starling third-party integrations fall into three categories. Flux and the bank’s upcoming partnership with TransferWise are examples of the deepest type of Starling app integration but isn’t typical.
Instead, whilst they’ll be discoverable and can be authorised via something akin to an app store within the Starling app, most Marketplace apps will only send back and display a limited amount of data in the form of a dashboard or ‘widget’ (my words, not Caywood’s). If I understand correctly, in certain instances this trade-off reduces the regulatory burden on Starling and, crucially, is a good compromise to stop the Starling app from becoming bloated.
A third category of integration are apps that simply make use of Starling’s API. Right now, these include Tail, the local offers startup I recently covered, or roundups app Moneybox, which use the API to authenticate, access and build on top of various levels of your Starling bank account data and functionality, with your permission, of course.
“TransferWise will be one end of the spectrum, being deeply integrated, whereas Moneybox is at the other end of the spectrum where they just integrate our API but don’t appear in Starling,” Caywood tells me. “The Marketplace portion of the app is a hybrid – where an app has integrated our API and we have integrated theirs, so users can find them and connect to them via the Starling app, and have a dashboard in Starling that gives an overview”.
Meanwhile, I’m hearing that Flux has closed $1.5 million in seed funding led by PROfounders. I also understand that Anthemis, which has invested in other fintech companies such as Currency Cloud and Azimo, participated in the round.",2017-09-12,1538647,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/flux-receipt-in-starling.png?w=738,europe/,"starling-bank,flux","Starling Bank launches Marketplace, integrates with itemised receipt and rewards startup Flux",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/
Alex Wilhelm,Europe,"

Looking at the number of exits produced and the total dollar volume those liquidity events commanded, the European startup scene has shown growth over the past year.
That fact comes from the Startups M&A 2017 Report — made in partnership with Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge. The report details the growth and maturation of the global startup scene, with a particular focus on the European continent and its most recent exit results.
This is the second time Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge have worked together to dive into the world of European startups. Last year the data, as noted on TechCrunch at the time, indicated that in the last half decade “U.S. companies have purchased about four times as many startups as European acquirers.”
So how much has changed since the last report?
The number of global startup exits from 2011 to 2017 has shown rapid growth, especially since 2014, a year that could be fairly tagged as one of the peaks in the unicorn cycle. According to the report, the 12-month period ending July, 2017 saw 4,217 startup exits, up from 2,976 in the preceding period.
However, that growth was not mirrored in the value of those exits. Of course, we are dealing with partial exit numbers, as many liquidity events are never price-disclosed. Regardless of that caveat, the following chart was eye-catching:

(Date range: July 2010 to June 2017. From the document: “Annual data refers to the period July (previous)-June (listed).”)
Even though total deal volume increased, there are three possibilities that spring to mind concerning the deceleration in exit dollar worth of those startups:
Regardless, the 2017 period as listed above set new records. This implies, with caveats, that the environment is still quite good for startups looking to tap out, trade in or join up.
Writing from Silicon Valley, it’s easy to forget that other parts of California exist. But in addition to the rest of California, it turns out whole other continents feature startup activity.
For instance, it isn’t hard to find enthusiasm about Latin America. And we can even find a little bit too much exuberance in certain sectors of the Chinese startup world. Now let’s narrow the sight on Europe, as the report has several data points concerning the continent that are worth our time.
First, cutting down from the above chart here are the exit numbers, broken down by geographic region:

In the listed 2016 period, European exits accounted for just 42.5 percent of the U.S. total. In the 2017 period, that number had risen to 52.6 percent. Of course, the raw number of U.S. exits grew dramatically over the same period. So what’s the implication? In short, the European scene, despite growth in the U.S. market, managed to grab more relative exit share.
That’s pretty bullish. Now here are the same charts tracking known exit value:

Running the same numbers, here’s what we can say: In the 2016 period, European startup exits were worth just 30.6 percent of their U.S. counterparts. In the 2017-period, that number grew to 50.9 percent.
However, as the value of U.S. startup exits fell, we could be seeing the specter of undisclosed exit values coming to roost. How likely it is that the aggregate (know and unknown) dollar value was down in the U.S. compared to the year before is up to you to determine.
Regardless, the value of European startup exits went up as its deal volume rose.
Notable in the report is cross-border startup M&A between the U.S. and Europe. Given the strong trade ties between the two areas, it’s perhaps not surprising that there is quite a lot of cross-Atlantic startup deal making.
Here are three key data points:
Summing the three, both the U.S. and Europe largely conduct M&A deals inside their own borders, which isn’t shocking. Geographical proximity counts for a lot, even in our digital age, given the wildly varying local laws concerning IP, taxes and more. But that fact doesn’t stop the continents from buying from each other. In fact, of the companies that European startups buy, a quarter were from the U.S. They were purchased at high cost, it seems, as evinced by the 58 percent number. And on the other end of the ledger, U.S.-based companies were responsible for more than a third of European startup acquisitions.
That all points to a robust cross-Atlantic startup M&A market. What will become of it when a nearly inevitable correction occurs remains to be seen. For now, times are good.",2017-09-11,1538947,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/530833852.jpg?w=738,europe/,"mergers-and-acquisitions,exits","As global startup exits grow, Europe sees its profile rise",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/as-global-startup-exits-grow-europe-sees-its-profile-rise/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Well, this is quite a coup. Entrepreneur First (EF), the London-headquartered company builder that invests in individuals “pre-team, pre-idea” to help create new technology startups, has raised $12.4 million in new funding led by Silicon Valley’s Greylock Partners.
The investment also sees Greylock partner and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman join the board. In a call, Hoffman described EF as an incubation model that “contradicts common wisdom,” and exactly the sort of idea he seeks to back.
Other investors joining the round include Mosaic Ventures (I understand Mosaic’s Toby Coppel first introduced Hoffman to EF), Founders Fund, Lakestar Capital and Deep Mind founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman.
Notable is that a number of EF alumni are also investing. They are Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang of Magic Pony Technology — the AI startup sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and the company builder’s only financially significant exit to date — and Bryan Baum, who co-founded Represent, which was sold for a reported $100 million but went through the program before EF insisted on taking a stake in the companies it helps create.
It should also be noted that the new funding round is for operational costs and to further scale the EF program. In other words, it is entirely separate from the company builder’s investment fund from which it directly invests in the founders and startups it helps create. Therefore, this is more akin to EF as a startup in its own right raising funding.
Founded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, EF bills itself as a “talent first” investor that targets the best technical and domain talent in Europe and Singapore — both recent graduates and also people already working at tech companies — and invites them to apply to its six-month program where they find co-founders and in turn found startups.
The EF program includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider U.K. and Singapore startup scene. There’s also a separate follow-on fund to co-invest in alumni companies at the seed and Series A stage.
The idea is to help talented individuals become entrepreneurs, and companies be founded, that otherwise might not. To date, EF says it has helped more than 500 individuals on its program, who have built more than 100 companies with a total (mostly on paper) valuation exceeding $1 billion.
“Even though I don’t like to invest outside of Silicon Valley, the ability to create a portfolio of great entrepreneurship and great companies is something I treat as a personal mission,” Hoffman tells me, noting that Bentinck and Clifford have created a “great model for creating new, deep tech companies on an incubation basis.”
“I think where it’s helpful is when you have depth of tech talent, creativity, an interest in creating companies but an as yet only partially developed entrepreneurial culture,” he says when asked why a model like EF is needed outside Silicon Valley. (Separately, Clifford tells me EF has no plans to expand to the U.S.)
I recount how in EF’s early days — albeit before it was anything like proven — a number of VCs I spoke to had doubts the company builder’s “pre-team, pre-idea” model could work. Hoffman sounds unsurprised.
“The number of incubators and accelerators that have failed is huge,” he says, “so what happens is that most VCs tend to be ‘look, the real entrepreneurs are just willing to go and do it themselves,’ and I would say that is common sense wisdom. Common sense wisdom has a breadth of truth to it, [but] I like to look at where the common sense wisdom has a limitation and where there is a big opportunity.”
Hoffman says he can easily see “a universe in which there’s 20 or 30 or 40 cities, maybe even 50, where Entrepreneur First is integral to creating a set of interesting tech companies in those areas.” “You can reach scale if you get the formula right,” he argues, pointing to how Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator has grown in the last decade.
So why hasn’t anyone cloned EF’s model verbatim? Clifford says it’s partly network effects — a program like EF becomes more valuable the more quality founders and companies it adds — and whilst Reid doesn’t dispute this, the answer may be even simpler.
“The reason why they haven’t been copied yet is that people don’t have a full recognition of the really interesting thing that Entrepreneur First is doing,” he says. “And of course they try to keep some of the secret sauce under the covers, too.”
Before I wrap up our call, I turn the subject to the thorny issue of Brexit. Given that a large part of EF’s current program takes place in London but attracts applicants from all over Europe, was the U.K.’s decision to vote to leave the EU a consideration before Greylock decided to invest?
“I definitely thought about it,” says Hoffman. “The impact will I think be relatively harsh over the next five or 10 years, starting with the fact that I think people are under the illusion that there is an easy divorce from the EU.”
With that said — and factoring in that we don’t yet know what a post-Brexit world will look like — he reckons there’s still “easily enough headroom” in the U.K. to create world transforming companies.",2017-09-11,1538448,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-14-19-34.png?w=738,europe/,"greylock-partners,entrepreneur-first","Company builder Entrepreneur First raises $12.4M led by Greylock, Reid Hoffman joins board",reid-hoffman,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/ef-greylock/
Natasha Lomas,Advertising Tech,"Another privacy-related fine for Facebook in Europe: The Spanish data protection regulator has issued a €1.2M (~$1.4M) fine against the social media behemoth for a series of violations regarding its data-harvesting activities.
Spain’s AEPD said an investigation into how Facebook collects, stores and uses data for advertising purposes found it is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent.
It says it identified two serious infringements and one very serious infringement of data protection law — with the total sanction breaking down to €300,000 for each of the first breaches and €600,000 for the second.
The regulator found Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, religious beliefs, personal tastes and navigation — either directly, through users’ use of its services or from third party pages — without, in its judgement, “clearly informing the user about the use and purpose”.
Not obtaining express consent of users to process sensitive personal data is classified as a very serious offense under local DP law.
Facebook’s use of web browsing cookies was also found in violation of privacy laws, with the regulator saying it confirmed users are not informed that their information will be processed through the use of cookies when they are browsing non-Facebook pages that contain Facebook’s ‘Like’ button social plug in — noting that while some of the use of this data is declared as being for advertising, other use is “secret”, i.e. not disclosed by the company.
“This situation also occurs when users are not members of the social network but have ever visited one of its pages, as well as when users who are registered on Facebook browse through third party pages, even without logging on to Facebook. In these cases, the platform adds the information collected in said pages to the one associated with your account in the social network. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the information provided by Facebook to users does not comply with data protection regulations,” it noted.
The regulator is also unhappy that Facebook does not delete harvested data once it has finished using it — saying it had been able to verify Facebook does not delete web browsing habits data, but  in fact “retains and reuses it later associated with the same user”.
It also found this to be true even when the company had been explicitly requested to delete data by a user.
“Regarding data retention, when a social network user has deleted his account and requests the deletion of the information, Facebook captures and treats information for more than 17 months through a deleted account cookie. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the personal data of the users are not canceled in full or when they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were collected or when the user explicitly requests their removal, according to the requirements of the LOPD [local data protection law], which represents a serious infringement,” it said.
The AEPR, which noted it liaised with other DPAs — in Belgium, France, Germany (Hamburg) and the Netherlands, which also have their own separate investigations into these issues, initiated following Facebook’s 2015 T&Cs change — said Facebook’s existing privacy policy was judged to contain “generic and unclear terms”, and to “inaccurately” refer to the use it will make of the data it collects.
The regulator asserted that a Facebook user “with an average knowledge of the new technologies does not become aware of the collection of data, nor of their storage and subsequent treatment, nor of what they will be used”.
It also points out that unregistered Internet users would not be unaware that the social network collects their browsing data — something that has already got Facebook into trouble with other European DPAs.
Commenting on the regulator’s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us the company intends to appeal the decision, while also noting that its European business is (currently) regulated under Irish data protection rules, where its EU HQ is sited.
It provided the following statement:
The size of the AEPR fine is of course a mere pinprick for Facebook whose 2016 revenue was $27.64BN. So really its appeal against the fine is about the company trying to bat away any perception that it violates privacy by refuting the substance of the violations being asserted here.
But seen through the prism of stricter incoming EU data protection rules, under the new GDPR regime which comes into force next May, there are certainly serious financial considerations for Facebook’s business pertaining to privacy — as the new EU regime includes a far larger stick to beat companies that are judged to have violated data protection rules while also tightening up privacy rules by, for example, expanding the definition of personal data and giving EU citizens the right to ask for their data to be deleted.
Companies will be facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for privacy violations under GDPR. So, in Facebook’s case, privacy-related fines could start to scale to over a billion dollars. And penalties of that size aren’t something the tech giant can too often and too easily sweep under its revenue carpet.
Even as GDPR strengthens the consent requirements for processing personal data, and expands the risk of holding and processing lots of personal data.
In addition, a company like Facebook, which processes data across multiple EU Member States’ territories, may find the new regulation creates a situation where it faces more concerted action from other DPAs, i.e. beyond their local data authority where they’ve established a European base. So, in Facebook’s case, it may not so easily be able to claim to be only under the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. And in Europe, it’s fair to say that some DPAs are decided more pro-privacy than others.
Asked about its GDPR preparations, Facebook previously told us it has designated a cross-functional team to “fully analyze the legislation and help us understand what this would mean from a legal, policy and product perspective” — saying this is “the largest cross functional team in the history of the Facebook family”.
It is also now looking to recruit a data protection officer — a position mandated under GDPR.
“Ahead of next May we are working with our product, design and engineering teams to enhance existing products and build new products in a way that simultaneously provides an intuitive, user-centric experience and permits us to meet our obligations under the GDPR,” added Stephen Deadman, Facebook’s deputy chief global privacy officer, in a statement.",2017-09-11,1538681,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/shutterstock_186292982a.jpg?w=738,europe/,"gdpr,general-data-protection-regulation,terms-of-service",Facebook fined €1.2M for privacy violations in Spain,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-fined-e1-2m-for-privacy-violations-in-spain/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"Filling out forms online and on mobile can be a tedious and bug-ridden — yet annoyingly necessary — experience. Today, a startup called Typeform has raised a significant round of capital to help fund its mission to change all that, with a platform that the startup claims gets its customers much better results because the interactive experiences created on it are more intuitive and thus easier to engage with.
The startup, based out of Barcelona, today announced a Series B of $35 million led by General Atlantic as it drives deeper into international markets, specifically the US; and expands its tools for developers with more analytics and artificial intelligence features to personalise the experience more. Along with the funding and in keeping with this platform focus, the company today is also announcing a new portal for developers.
“We are proud to be the first company to transform the online data collection space by creating conversational forms. But now we’d like to take things further,” said Robert Muñoz, co-CEO and cofounder of Typeform, in a statement. He believes that Typeform is playing a role in “bridging the gap between data collection and customer interaction.”
This round also included participation from Index Ventures, Point Nine, and Connect Ventures, all previous backers.
In total, Typeform has now raised just over $52 million. The valuation with this round is not being disclosed but in its last funding of around $15 million two years ago, Typeform was worth $70 million post-money, David Okuniev, Typeform’s other cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. He added that this latest funding was an “up-round” and its valuation has grown. (I’m asking around to see if I can get a more current number and will update when and if I learn more.)
He said the company is ‘almost’ profitable.
Other notable investors in Typeform include Anthony Casalena, CEO of Squarespace; Javier Olivan, VP of growth at Facebook; and Jay Parikh, Facebook’s VP of engineering.
It sometimes happens that the most successful startups are founded in response to an enterpreneur’s frustration with an existing product or service. And so it was the case with Typeform. Co-founders Muñoz and David Okuniev are both designers — specifically with focuses on interaction, UX, and UI — and were running their own agencies back in 2011, when they found themselves working jointly on a single brief (for a toilet company of all things).
When the client asked for a new form to help pick up new business leads and more customer data, the pair were unable to find any suitable online templates or platforms that would not only get users to fill out their information with reliable regularity (no pun intended to the toilet company) but provide details that could be used for sales in the future.
“We felt there was a lack of attention given to engaging users in the first place,” Okuniev said, who added that the interaction that had been invented for forms hadn’t changed since the 1990s. 
The two set out to build something themselves, and then used that as the basis of what became Typeform, first launched in 2012, a more dynamic form-creating interface that presented questions one at a time. “We wanted to address that in a serious way, but you could also say it was accidental,” Okuniev said. “We had no intention of building a startup out of this.”
Today, creating basic online forms is nearly a commoditised business, with companies like Google offering products like Forms free of charge, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter letting people create free polls and other services, and so on.
Unsurprisingly, Typeform has been iterating on its original product over the years, and today concentrates more on APIs and other developer tools, which are offered in a freemium model based on usage and additional features.
At the same time, the startup has very much pushed into making its service something that one can use in any scenario where a user might need to enter data: from basic information entry like job application and contact forms; through to surveys; registration forms; shopping and order forms; online learning and tests; and invitations.
The flexibility of the platform, and the focus on making more dynamic interactive experiences, translates into results. Okuniev said that the average conversion rate on one of Typeform’s forms — whether it’s a questionnaire, customer service request, quiz, poll, order form, or something else — is 57 percent, compared to a conversion rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent for more conventional forms. 
Its success is also playing out in user numbers. Today, Okuniev said that the company has 30,000 paying customers, and “a lot more” than this using its free tier. Customers include both small and medium sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies in the tech, retail, and hospitality industries.
Typeform’s today describes its form-filling platform as “conversational”, but its original concept behind that pre-dates a lot of the talk we hear today about conversational AI, and bots.
On the other hand, Typeform’s ethos is also very contemporary: it focuses on presenting and asking for information using conversational language, and works on the basis of feeding questions one at a time and getting answers in return and tailoring subsequent questions based on those responses.
That being said, today, the startup does not use any AI in its platform, although it’s being considered, either by growing it in-house (today the company has around 170 employees, including engineers), or by partnering with an existing firm, or potentially through an acquisition.
“AI is definitely on our minds,” Okuniev said. “We are doing some projects internally around user behaviour around form entry and we will be integrating that into the product soon. We want to help our customers generate more conversations, and we think our products could help with that.”
The focus on creating an interactive platform based around natural language is one reason why investors were interested in helping fund the startup to grow.
“Digital forms are transitioning from a simple data-collection tool into an integral part of the customer engagement journey,” said Chris Caulkin of General Atlantic, in a statement.
So, too, is the platform flexibility. “If you think about the proliferation of device types and browsers, including forms and data collection can be a real pain point,” Caulkin said in an interview. “And the solution that Typeform has developed can be easily integrated and managed by the product, not the tech, team.”
Caulkin is joining Typeform’s board with this round.
The interactivity and square focus on sales and customer relationships also makes the company a prime target for acquisition, in my opinion, with companies such as Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Microsoft/LinkedIn and many others all looking at better ways to help businesses interface with users, particularly across platforms with more tricky interfaces, like mobile. In the meantime, Typeform is also working on integrating more with other, existing platforms, such as Mail Chimp.",2017-09-11,1538674,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/7.jpg?w=738,europe/,"crm,forms,general-atlantic,typeform","Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"French fintech startup Bankin is partnering with another fintech startup, Yomoni. Bankin brings all you your bank accounts together in a single, unified interface. It’s a sort of Mint, but for the French market.
Bankin also competes with another app that I covered just a couple of days ago, Linxo. Both of them want to become the definite financial hub to get an overview on all your accounts, move money around and more. They all dream about becoming the ultimate banking app to rule them all.
And Bankin has already started morphing beyond a simple way to check all your accounts. You can already transfer money between multiple accounts without ever leaving the app. While only a handful of banks currently support this feature, I’m sure the company is working hard on adding more banks.
Starting today, Bankin users will also get a notification in the  notification tab (“Coach”) about tips to save money. If you tap on it, it gives you tips as well as a button to get advice. It then tells you to open an account with Yomoni to save money.

Natasha Lomas,Europe,"The oversight court for the UK’s intelligence agencies has said Europe’s top court should rule on the legality of powers that give the country’s spies the ability to collect and interrogate various forms of data in bulk (aka mass surveillance).
State agencies’ current use of bulk collection has been challenged by privacy rights group, Privacy International, which asked the tribunal to consider the lawfulness of the use of so-called “Bulk Communications Data” (BCD), and “Bulk Personal Data (BPD) under European human rights law.
BCD refers to communications metadata — so the what, where, who and why of digital communications (excluding the content of messages, but with all the granular digital data points needed to triangulate and infer massive amounts of context).
While BPD refers to large databases of personal information maintained and utilized by intelligence agencies, plugged into their analytics systems (so fully searchable via their ‘selectors’), with data, scraped from various public and private/commercial sources, which can include highly sensitive information such as political affiliation, sexual orientation, religion, racial and ethnic origin.
Last year the tribunal ruled that UK agencies’ use of bulk powers had been illegal for a period of around a decade, prior to 2015 — because they had not been avowed in parliament. The difference now is the government has written bulk collection into law. But the question is whether in doing so it has breached EU human rights law.
In a judgement handed down yesterday the Investigatory Powers tribunal said both sides saw the necessity for a reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ)’s grand chamber.
During the course of this case, the ECJ has ruled on another challenge — brought against emergency surveillance legislation rushed through the UK parliament in 2014 (called DRIPA) — stating in December that “general and indiscriminate” state data retention regimes contravene EU law.
But while DRIPA was overturned by the ruling, it was temporary legislation and had already been sunsetted in the UK — replaced by a new surveillance regime: the Investigatory Powers Act. So it’s a legal challenge to the bulk powers contained within that current regime that’s ongoing here.
And even though EU judges have already made it clear EU Member States cannot establish “general and indiscriminate” data retention regimes, the government is trying to drive a wedge between that finding and matters of national security, arguing that the use of bulk data capabilities is “critical” to national security.
Intelligence agencies also told the court that if December’s ECJ Watson judgement — named for the Labour politician, Tom Watson, who brought the challenge — were applied in the field of national security it “would effectively cripple the SIAs’ [security and intelligence agencies’] Bulk Data capabilities”.
The tribunal, which was established in 2000 and prior to the fallout from the 2013 Snowden disclosures about government’s mass surveillance programs had never upheld a complaint against the agencies whose work it is tasked with overseeing, said in its judgement: “We have carefully considered the evidence before us, both from the Claimant and the Respondents, and we are persuaded that if the Watson Requirements do apply to measures taken to safeguard national security, in particular the BCD regime, they would frustrate them and put the national security of the United Kingdom, and, it may be, other Member States, at risk.”
“By the end of the hearing it was clear that both parties either agreed to or saw the necessity for a reference to the Grand Chamber, and the need for it is, we suggest, obvious from this Judgment,” it added. “Neither party in the event contended that the questions we have considered are either acte clair, or acte éclairé as a result of the Watson judgment.”
The Guardian reports that part of the state evidence given to judges included a statement from MI5’s deputy director in which he claimed that without BCD it would be necessary for the intelligence agencies to carry out “other and more intrusive inquiries” — such as making “many more individual requests for CD [communications data] or use other more intrusive powers in order to narrow the scope of a search”.
“The inability to use BCD would therefore involve greater intrusion into the privacy of individuals,” the MI5 deputy director also claimed.
The tribunal also heard evidence from agencies that in 2005, and on the basis of what they couched as “sensitive but fragmentary intelligence”, agencies had been able to apply filters to a BPD to reduce “pool of 27,000 candidates” down to one person who they claim was identified as a “suspected potential al-Qaida suicide bomber”.
On the other side of the argument, Privacy International’s lawyers pointed out that metadata in the modern Internet age is massively revealing about individuals — therefore necessitating “strict safeguards against the state accessing highly sensitive information about us”.
The group said it fundamentally disagrees with the government’s position that data access safeguards set out the Watson judgement — such as requiring a judge to approve access to highly sensitive information — should not apply to national security.
The UK’s now defunct DRIPA regime was rushed through parliament in 2014, and subsequently ruled unlawful under European Human Rights law by a UK high court in 2015 — after a civil rights group challenged it for targeting an overly broad range of data and having an extremely lax access regime.
Yet the government persisted in pushing to legislate for a permanent state surveillance regime that cements bulk collection as its foundational core, claiming such powers are necessary for counterterrorism efforts.
At the end of 2016 parliament passed the current legislative framework for investigatory powers, cementing the intelligence agencies’ old bulk processes into dedicated legislation. Previously agencies had relied on vague clauses in obscure and outdated laws to authorize their use of the powers (illegally, as it turned out).
The new IP Act has also expanded the UK state’s bulk collection via a new requirement for ISPs to retain browsing data on all their users for 12 months. Though, on the flip side, it also brings in a new oversight regime for use of the most intrusive powers based on warrants being authorized by ministers and judges. This does not apply to accessing the ISP browsing data, however.
In yesterday’s judgement the intelligence agencies’ oversight court refused Privacy International’s request to expedite the matter to the ECJ — which means it will likely take years more before the court makes a judgement.
At which point the UK will be further down the road of the brexit process of leaving the Union — and the government has said it wishes to remove the country from the jurisdiction of the ECJ.
So years more uncertainty are a given here. And, yes, that is the sound of a can being kicked very far down the road. Let’s all go and look at some cats.",2017-09-09,1538335,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/3029613413_145219499e_b.jpg?w=738,europe/,"law-enforcement,national-security,government,prevention","Europe’s top court must rule on UK spies’ bulk powers, says tribunal",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/europes-top-court-must-rule-on-uk-spies-bulk-powers-says-tribunal/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"French startup Linxo just raised $24 million (€20 million) from three financial institutions — Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa and MAIF. The company is building a sort of Mint for the French market.
Banking apps suck in France. Most of them are just a wrapper around a mobile website. It takes them years to adopt new features, such as fingerprint readers, widgets and more.
And many people have more than one bank account. It becomes quite tedious to check your balance and transactions on all your accounts as you have to deal with multiple shitty apps.
Linxo is trying to solve that by building an above average app and service that connects to all your bank accounts. The startup supports dozens of French banks. At first, you need to give Linxo your bank account login information. The company’s servers will then periodically sync past transactions.
This way, you get a good overview of all your bank accounts in one app. You can see past transactions and charts about money you’re spending. It’s a good way to get insights about your financial situation.
But the company plans to go one step further and build a full-fledged financial hub. Its competitor Bankin has already introduced a way to transfer money between accounts in different banks. This feature is currently limited to a handful of banks.
I’m sure Linxo has something similar in mind, as well as ways to save money, get a credit line and buy insurance products. The company has been working on Linxo Connect, a way to sign up to new financial services without leaving the app, using APIs.
With today’s funding round, the startup plans to expand to other European countries. Linxo is also working with French banks to help them with their apps and websites. This could be a lucrative market as well.",2017-09-09,1538050,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/455316308.jpg?w=738,europe/,france-newsletter,Linxo raises $24 million for its app that brings bank accounts together,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/linxo-raises-24-million-for-its-app-that-brings-bank-accounts-together/
Mike Butcher,Europe,"So much for a smooth launch. Ride-hailing startup Taxify launched this week in London to a big PR-push and fanfare. Most of the coverage was about how this plucky startup was going to take on the Uber giant. But Taxify has now had to pause its operations in London after a transport union questioned if it had a license to operate, and official body Transport for London announced it would investigate Taxify’s operations. Meanwhile, the startup has been tweeting drivers that download and use its app not to say they are “employed by Taxify.”
So what is going on?
(UPDATE: Taxify has now issued a statement saying it has “done everything in its power to comply with the local regulations, but is faced by aggression from TfL.” It says that running Taxify as a technology platform directing bookings to City Drive Services registered drivers is “completely compliant within the existing UK law, and is a common practice.” TfL has revoked the license held by City Drive Services).
A few months ago, Taxify applied for a license to operate a taxi service in London. This is important, because there is a big misunderstanding going on here about what Taxify is: it’s actually fleet management software in the cloud. Cab firms sign up for it, and use it to replace their tired old booking software, while Taxify takes a low fee. In other words, Taxify doesn’t want to run cab or private car firms. It’s basically a tech front for licensed cab firms that could never build and manage such complex software themselves. But to launch in London, it needed a way in.
Well-placed sources say Taxify reached out to TfL in April about launch, but TfL was “walling” the firm, say the sources. Faced with a slow-moving bureaucracy, Taxify went ahead and literally bought a local cab firm, City Drive Services. This has a licence to operate with TfL, trading under two brand names, Avanti Car Service CityDrive and Sigma Car Service.
For Taxify is not just a plucky little startup taking on Uber — it’s now backed by Chinese ride-hailing tech giant Didi Chuxing in China.
Somehow, Taxify thought that just by buying a cab firm with a license, installing its cloud services and apps with the drivers, it could would then have carte blanche to launch its service in London.
Er, no. Taxi regulation doesn’t work like that.
The powerful GMB Union wrote to TfL saying: “The decision to acquire an operator and not advise Transport for London (TfL) of a fundamental change to licensing conditions seems incompatible with the law.” It questioned whether the firm is “fit and proper” to hold a licence with TfL, asking about driver safety, and saying there is “obfuscation” about how Taxify actually works and operates.
They may well have a point.
Taxify is clearly trying to shoe-horn its service into London, not by encouraging local players to sign up for its service, but by literally acquiring a local player and launching. It’s not clear yet whether it had actually outlined this to TfL.
But Founder and CEO Markus Villig says he has spoken to lawyers about the arrangement: “We have literally sent them (TfL) an email every 3 days, so they knew very well we were launching.”
A TfL spokesperson said: “Taxify is not a London licensed private hire operator. We are urgently investigating the nature and extent of its activities and will take action where appropriate.”
Taxify launched in Estonia in 2013 and now operates in 18 countries, mainly emerging markets like Eastern Europe and Africa. The startup claims to have more than 2.5 million customers, and recently announced a strategic partnership with Didi Chuxing in China.
It has an “all-in-one solution for taxi companies.” Basically, a booking system with a consumer-facing app. Traditional taxi companies use Taxify’s web-based dispatcher and fleet management systems to manage their back-end and unite under Taxify’s consumer-facing app to stay competitive against expanding networks like Hailo and Uber. That then lowers Taxify’s costs, allowing them to charge less. It then charges the cab firm a low monthly fee of about €12-15 per driver per month.
Taxify’s other focus is its rapidly growing Local Partner program, which allows entrepreneurs to set up their local Taxify business using a franchise model and become a city manager on a revenue share model.
UPDATE: Taxify has now issued the below statement:",2017-09-08,1537936,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/taxify.png?w=738,europe/,taxify,Taxify’s London launch halted after transport regulator mounts investigation,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/taxifys-london-launch-halted-after-transport-regulator-mounts-investigation/
Natasha Lomas,Europe,"U.S. consumers hearing the news yesterday of a massive Equifax data breach, which the company revealed potentially affects 143 million consumers, and includes data such as names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, drivers’ licenses and — for a subset of hundreds of thousands — credit card information too, not only had to contemplate the horrendous scale of the thing.
They were also left to grapple with an Equifax ’emergency response line’ that hung up on them, and an Equifax data breach ‘help’ website that appears to raise a lot more questions than it answers — not least the core consideration that it’s requiring desperately worried consumers to trust a company that has failed to protect their personal data with more of their personal data, by inputting it into a web form, just to check whether they might be affected by the breach.
And that’s before you even consider whether Equifax is trying to use the site’s terms of service to get users to waive their rights to bring a class action lawsuit against it — as appears to be the case. Which would be spectacularly unclassy, to say the least.
The cherry on this unlovely layer cake is the fact the credit checking company states it found out about the breach on “July 29 of this year” — while the unauthorized access apparently occurred “from mid-May through July 2017”.
Which means it’s given itself well over a month before deigning to tell consumers their personal data might be in the hands of identity thieves.
That might not seem so bad if you compare it to the current biggest (known) data breaches — affecting at least 500M Yahoo accounts, and more than 1BN Yahoo accounts — which took place years before the company disclosed the intrusions to the public, although it’s not clear when exactly Yahoo itself discovered the breaches.
Even so, 40 days remains an awfully long time for consumers to be kept in the dark about the fact their identities and other highly sensitive personal data might be being traded by hackers, used to compromise other services, and sold to spammers for targeted spearphishing attacks.
Equifax does not explain the length of time it took to inform the public about the breach. And yesterday said it “will” be writing directly to affected individuals, and is “in the process of” contacting state and federal regulators. So, very clearly, the company hasn’t been spending any of the past 40 days warning affected individuals or informing data watchdogs that its systems had been breached.
The US does not currently have a federal law requiring companies to inform the public about data breaches, though one was proposed in 2015 under President Obama which would have set a 30-day notification requirement, but it failed to get support.
And while the vast majority of states have enacted breach notification statutes of their own at this point, and some have stricter notification requirements than the 2015 proposal, others don’t. It’s a patchwork — and therefore a lottery for U.S. consumers.
Over the pond in the European Union the story is different. A single breach notification standard for personal data was agreed at the end of 2015 — and is set to come into force in May 2018, under the incoming GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).
This will set a data breach notification bar across the bloc of “not later than 72 hours” after a data controller has become aware of an intrusion.
There are some caveats to this portion (Article 33) of the regulation (phrases like “without undue delay and, where feasible”, and some potential for exclusion based on the type of data being breached (“unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”).
But the expectation is clearly that data controllers must disclose a personal data breach to a national supervisor data authority, at the very least, radically sooner than the ’40 days later’ which Equifax reckons is an acceptable disclosure timeframe.
(While the type of data involved in the Equifax breach is clearly highly sensitive, so this incident would seem a very unlikely candidate for qualifying for a notification exemption under GDPR.)
Another change Europe’s incoming rules are bringing is a big stick to drive compliance for the new breach notification standard, as companies that do not comply with the new rules risk very stiff penalties for failing to do so.
In the case of non-compliance over breach notification, the GDPR gives data watchdogs the power to issue fines of up to €10M (~$12M) — or up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of a company’s preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
In Equifax’s case its 2016 operating revenue was ~$3.145BN. So — under the GDPR regime — the company might have faced a fine of around $62.9M if it hadn’t reported this data breach multiple weeks sooner than it chose to. (Indeed, it’s expecting its full year 2017 revenue to be even higher, between $3.395BN and $3.425BN, so this theoretical fine inflates to as much as $68.5M.)
Which does rather give pause for thought.
If you’re a multinational corporation processing the personal data of EU citizens those sorts of figures probably send some rather large shivers down the CEO’s spine.
Equifax does indeed have a European presence, and has also said that some UK consumers are affected by the breach — writing yesterday that as part of its investigation it “also identified unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain UK and Canadian residents”, and adding: “Equifax will work with UK and Canadian regulators to determine appropriate next steps.”
So if these events had been shifted just a few months into the future Equifax might well have been forced to handle the breach disclosure very differently — or else it would be risking a very large fine under GDPR.
The question then would be, would it have informed the UK regulatory of the breach within 72 hours whilst continuing to keep U.S. data watchdogs and U.S. consumers in the dark? That wouldn’t seem like great domestic PR.
The aim of Europe’s new rules is of course to encourage companies that collect and store consumers’ personal data not to treat the security of that data as an afterthought. And large fines for failure is certainly one way to grease the pipe of security spending among corporates.
As the UK’s DPA warns on its website in an FAQ about the new breach notification rules: “In light of the tight timescales for reporting a breach – it is important to have robust breach detection, investigation and internal reporting procedures in place.”
While an interesting potential side-effect of the new, tougher regime is whether it will end up forcing higher standards on non-European businesses, especially those in the U.S. — given many do handle EU citizens’ data, and will therefore need to reconfigure their processes to meet the bloc’s new standard.
(The GDPR also expands the definition of what personal data is, and brings additional requirements such as a right for consumers to see what information is held about them and have it deleted on request — so there are other big changes incoming.)
We’ve reached out to Equifax in the UK for comment and will update this post with any response.
In a statement, the deputy commissioner of the UK’s data protection watchdog, commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone, told us: “Reports of a significant data loss at US-based Equifax and the potential impact on some UK citizens gives us cause for concern. We are already in direct contact with Equifax to establish the facts including how many people in the UK have been affected and what kind of personal data may have been compromised.”
“We will be advising Equifax to alert affected UK customers at the earliest opportunity,” he added.
I’ll leave you with this final food-for-thought:

Mike Butcher,Europe,"You’d think all the business models around on-demand taxis and cars had been invested, but straight out of Siberia comes another one.
Ride-hailing app inDriver has raised a $5 million Series A round from Russian venture fund LETA Capital. They aim to use this cash to launch inDriver in India, the USA and Canada, where the service will of course compete with Uber, Lyft and Ola Cab.
How on earth will they attempt this, rather optimistic, feat? Well, for starters, drivers themselves pay for to access the app, rather than the app’s operation effectively being subsidised by venture capital, as the other are. Next, inDriver is a decentralized, bid-style service, where the passenger enters the price he or she is willing to pay, while the driver accepts the order only upon agreement of the fare. inDriver does not influence price formation and doesn’t take a commission from drivers. All drivers do is simply pay by the hour to use the app, at a flat rate. A passenger can pay either with cash, or with credit card, but payment happens only directly between driver and rider.
The service’s simplicity means it has expanded to 70 cities in Russia and neighbouring markets. It claims to have about 7 million installations across iOS, Android and Windows Phones. Each month inDriver’s users make around 4-5 million trips, and the total number of trips is close to 100 million, they claim. inDriver also offers the option to travel between cities, much like BlaBlaCar.
The inDriver service was created in Yakutsk – a small town in Siberia. Their story goes that during a freezing winter day on Christmas Eve, when the temperature fell to -49°F, all the local taxi services simultaneously doubled their prices. To fight this, some students formed a public group on the VK.com social network (a clone of Facebook), where anyone could submit an application for a ride, and those who owned cars could accept their calls for help. After a year the group had 50,000 subscribers. Later, Yakutian tech entrepreneur Arsen Tomskiy “bought” the group from its creators (only in Russia could you buy a VK group…) , releasing a mobile app based on the group. QED.
inDriver says its has been profitable from its first year of existence, because the company does not subsidize its drivers, like Uber does. When the app is launched in a new city, it is free for all drivers for the first several months, and later the company adds a subscription fee to access the order database. In Russia, depending on the city, the price can vary from $0.50 to $2 per hour. Pretty competitive.
CEO Arsen Tomskiy said they chose LETA Capital because it “already has the experience of successful international exits from companies’ portfolios, including the recent sale of a stake in the Unomy start-up to the international giant WeWork.”",2017-09-07,1537467,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/beijing-taxi.jpg?w=738,europe/,leta-capital,Straight outta Siberia — inDriver raises $5M for its flat-rate ride-hailing app,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/straight-outta-siberia-indriver-raises-5m-for-its-flat-rate-ride-hailing-app/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"French startup Streamroot just raised $3.2 million from Partech Ventures, Techstars Venture Capital Fund, Verizon Ventures* and R/GA. The company is taking advantage of WebRTC to make video streaming much cheaper.
When you’re watching a video on YouTube or Netflix, those companies send a video file to your device from their servers. It’s a straightforward, one-way transaction between a data center and your device. That’s why tech companies spend a ton of money on bandwidth because video files are heavy.
Streamroot wants to change this model by adding a peer-to-peer layer. Companies like Dailymotion, Canal+, Eurosport and Russia Today have been using Streamroot’s technology so that not all videos come from their servers.
Let’s say you’re watching Taylor Swift’s latest music video on Dailymotion. As Taylor Swift is quite popular, chances are a bunch of people are already watching her video at the same time. Streamroot is going to download part or all of her video from another user directly.
So Dailymotion can deliver 2 different views without sending the file twice from its own servers. It works particularly well for big spikes of traffic on the same video.
The best part is that it’s completely transparent for the user. You don’t have to install anything as most modern web browsers support WebRTC’s most advanced features on desktop and mobile. And if you’re watching an obscure video, Streamroot will just tell your browser to look for the video on a traditional server. It’s the best of both worlds

Natasha Lomas,Europe,"European Union defense ministers have been taking part in a simulated cyber attack exercise today for the first time to practice strategic decision making and crisis-management under pressure of a (mock) cyber-attack against the bloc’s military structures.
The two-hour war game exercise, named EU CYBRID 2017, was held in Tallinn, Estonia, where the EU defense ministers are meeting for informal discussions on a range of security issues.
Cyber attacks targeting and damage civilian infrastructure, such as powerplants, was not included in this particular exercise. Although recent malware activity, such as the Wannacry ransomeware attacks, which locked some UK hospitals out of their IT systems and led to operations being canceled, likely contributed to the decision to run the exercise, said a minister of defense spokeswoman.
She said the fictitious scenario focused on threats to military operations in the Mediterranean.
According to Reuters the exercise involved the EU’s naval mission in the Mediterranean being sabotaged by hackers who cripple the mission’s command on land while also launching a campaign on social media to discredit EU operations and provoke protests.
The exercise was generally aimed at giving ministers the chance to practice situational awareness, crisis management and strategic communication between member states — with the overarching goal of moving towards establishing a policy guideline for the European Union to adopt in the event of such a cyber war situation.
Increasing defense ministers’ awareness about the potential scale of risks posed by cyber attacks appears to be an early take-away from the exercise, according to the spokeswoman.
“What we’ve seen is that the ministers were very interested in it, and it gave them an overview of the threat and what could happen actually because the scenario was built up in such a way that the situation is escalating,” she told us. “In the beginning it might seem like a small thing… It’s pretty hard to assess how big a deal it is. They got an overview that it can escalate to a very, very serious business and that can attack also the military operations.”
“The exercise wasn’t about finding a very concrete, one solution. It was just to get the [understanding] to watch this road,” she added, emphasizing that it’s the first time such an exercise has taken place with defense ministers — and describing it as the “first step” on the road towards a better “common understanding”, which is the necessary base for the EU being able to establish guidelines to respond to (real) cyber attacks against its military structures.
Commenting on the exercise in a statement, Estonia’s minister for defense, Jüri Luik, added: “The cyber world and cyber threats do not recognise national boundaries or the barriers between organisations. It is therefore important to perform joint exercises of this kind, between European Union member states as well as the EU and NATO. We must exchange information and have a common understanding, in order to ensure improved preparedness for dealing with cyber threats.”",2017-09-07,1537058,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/eucybrid2017.jpg?w=738,europe/,"national-security,hacking,cyberattack,cyberwarfare",EU defense ministers take part in first cyber war game,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/eu-defense-ministers-take-part-in-first-cyber-war-game/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"VizEat, the European “social eating platform” that connects travellers and local hosts around authentic food experiences — such as dining in a local’s home, cooking classes, and food tours — has acquired EatWith, a similar startup headquartered in San Francisco.
Terms of the deal are undisclosed. EatWith is thought to have raised over $8 million from backers such as Greylock Partners, which led the company’s Series A round in late 2014.
“As a policy, we don’t disclose deal terms,” a spokesperson for VizEat tells me. “VizEat will be acquiring EatWith.com as an entire entity (including website and current ongoing activity) to expand its global offering of immersive food experiences with locals. EatWith hosts will also be given access to the wider offering for the group’s global partners with the tourism and travel industry, both online and traditional”.
Furthermore, I understand that EatWith’s founders had already left the startup, but that key team members of the EatWith team in San Francisco and Tel-Aviv are joining the combined entity. “They will manage and expand the host community and the partnerships. More hires will be done in the coming months,” says VizEat. In addition, EatWith will continue its existing partnership with TripAdvisor, which CrunchBase also lists as a backer.
Meanwhile, VizEat says the acquisition of EatWith makes it the leader for enabling social eating experiences with locals and puts the startup at the forefront of the sharing economy within the food and travel sectors. It claims more than 25,000 hosts across 130 countries, with localised versions of its app available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Chinese.

Mike Butcher,Europe,"As the Blockchain and Crypto world gathers pace, vehicles to allow for the creation, promotion and management of crypto investment funds are growing. The Iconomi Digital Assets Management Platform enables users to invest and manage various digital assets. Meanwhile, Melonport is building a blockchain protocol for digital asset management, initially built on the Ethereum platform. This is basically a framework for blockchain-enabled hedge funds.
Right now, most tokenized investment vehicles are either fully crypto-oriented or pegged to a tradable asset, like the U.S. dollar or gold. But creating access to fiat investment opportunities would diversify the income sources while at the same time retaining all the benefits of the crypto universe, such as transparency. Additionally, investors would get a higher return, because tokenized funds are much more cost-efficient than traditional ones.
Now, Blackmoon Financial Group, a financial technology and investment management company, has launched Blackmoon Crypto (BMC), a blockchain-based platform for — guess what — tokenized investment funds. BMC claims it has found a way to make crypto investments legal and secure, which would be significant, given the recent SEC decision to classify some tokens as securities.
The move might not be considered so worthy of note, were it not for the fact that these are not a bunch of pie-in-the-sky, fly-by-night crypto cowboys. For one, the company has attracted $3.5 million in venture capital investment from Target Global, AN&N Investments, Flint Capital, and several other private investors. And right now, Blackmoon’s lending marketplace is operating in 9 countries and exceeds $100M in deals volume, while reaching $13M in monthly volumes.
Last Friday it passed a $10M pre-ICO threshold with more than 2500 paid accounts. As a result, BMC closed its pre-sale after the first 2 weeks, indicating a strong public interest in the project and the forthcoming ICO. It’s ICO is now slated for September 12th.
The idea is to offer a new standard for tokenized investment vehicles that will bridge the gap between fiat and crypto universes by creating a way for asset managers to create and manage legally compliant tokenized funds. This would include everything from technology and infrastructure to legal framework and corporate structuring. Eventually any experienced and approved investment manager would be able to create a fund based on Blackmoon Crypto’s platform. (The platform and its tokens are based on Ethereum and also the Waves blockchain).
The company is led by entrepreneurs and investors Oleg Seydak and Ilya Perekopsky (former VP and COO of VK, the Facebook clone previously founder buy Pavel Durov, who went on to create Telegram).
In addition, two well-known players in asset management are supporting the ICO. The first is Nicolas Tranter – founding director of Bibbsworth, which advises institutional asset managers in the UK and Europe, and is based in London. The other is John Hyman – partner at Ondra Partners, a leading corporate finance advisory boutique.
“Setting up the proper investment structure is a costly endeavour. Not all tokenized funds do this, which leads to greater regulatory risk for investors,” says Seydak. He thinks there needs to be an industry standard for setting up tokenized investment vehicles that would then be able to attract investments from private individuals and institutional investors of any kind. “That’s what the Blackmoon Crypto platform does; it pays attention to regulatory risk and bridges the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds.”
“Tokenized funds are more cost-efficient thanks to lower infrastructure and setup costs,” Sergey Vasin, Chief Investment Officer of Blackmoon. “This economy is transmitted to investors in the form of higher net return. The cherry on top is that, fund tokens are also immediately tradable.”",2017-09-06,1536913,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-634632760.jpg?w=738,europe/,blackmoon,Blackmoon to ICO its blockchain-based platform for tokenized investment funds,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/blackmoon-to-ico-its-blockchain-based-platform-for-tokenized-investment-funds/
Natasha Lomas,Asia,"Apple is preparing to draw scores of eyes to Cupertino later today as it unboxes a clutch of new iPhones, including a new premium handset, called the iPhone X, slated to have a near bezel-less OLED display, a 3D face unlock feature and a $1,000+ price-tag, while bringing various new camera and feature tweaks — many of which have leaked in recent weeks.
Even so, the new iPhones are set to look like, well, iPhones — aka slabs of expensively shiny glass.
So what better time for rival Samsung to tease that it might finally be nearing the point of outing something rather different: A smartphone with a foldable screen — encouraging consumers who might be thinking of shelling out serious bucks for Apple’s new glass slabs to think twice.
Bloomberg reports that Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung’s mobile business, has said the company is setting its sights on 2018 to release a smartphone with a bendable display.
“As the head of the business, I can say our current goal is next year,” he told reporters. “When we can overcome some problems for sure, we will launch the product.”
He was speaking at a press event in South Korea announcing the Galaxy Note 8 phablet to domestic media. The future foldable phone is intended to sit in the same Galaxy Note portfolio line-up, according to his comments.
Samsung has been teasing the fact it’s working on a bendable device for multiple years now — showing investors a range of folding prototypes in 2013, and teasing bendy screen concepts (branded Youm) at CES that year. Though its tests date back further still, while it’s been showing off concept videos of flexible devices for a similarly long time.
But while Samsung has been happy to scatter suggestive tidbits about its folding phone plans over the years, the date for a potential commercial release has never been firmed up. Instead possible release years have been mentioned then pushed further forward in time — apparently as it encountered new manufacturing complications.
So it’s fair to say that the latest claim — that 2018 might finally be the year of the folding phone  — should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Especially as the timing of the tease coincides with the most important date in the Apple calendar: iPhone X day.
And, well, let’s face it, concept smartphones don’t have a great record of ever seeing the light of day either.
Even if you assume Samsung has made some progress on its bendable prototypes, having worked on the concept for more than five years at this point, there’s no doubt that creating a screen robust enough to be opened and closed (and prodded) as much as 150 times+ a day by touchscreen-addicted humans is a huge challenge.
And after the flaming disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, which had to be recalled after some batteries caught fire, the risk-margin for Samsung on this potential release must be very tight indeed…
No one wants a folding phone if that means screen glitches and/or a handset that feels tacky and whose dimensions hark back to the heft of late 1990s mobile devices.
(For the record, Samsung’s folding phone has been rumored to be called the Galaxy X. So Apple’s choice of premium brand name for its top tier new iPhone is probably causing more than a little irritation in South Korea.)
We’re liveblogging Apple’s launch event here, and here’s details on how to watch the keynote. So stay tuned for all the news from Cupertino.
Bloomberg also reported Samsung’s Dong-jin saying it’s working with audio device maker Harman, which it acquired last year, to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled speaker for voice commanding to play music and conduct other tasks — aka an Amazon Echo inspired Apple HomePod clone in the making.",2017-09-12,1539162,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2729.jpg?w=738,asia/,"smartphone,harman,iphone","Ahead of iPhone X day, Samsung teases 2018 foldable phone launch plan",samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/ahead-of-iphone-x-day-samsung-teases-2018-foldable-phone-launch-plan/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Southeast Asia-based fashion marketplace Zilingo has closed an $18 million Series B funding round led by Sequoia Capital India and Burda Principal Investments.
Zilingo was founded less than two years ago by ex Sequoia analyst Ankiti Bose (CEO) and former Yahoo engineer Dhruv Kapoor (CTO). The basic vision is to help Southeast Asia’s thriving independent fashion sellers and boutiques stores expand their businesses online.
The startup had existed largely under the radar until it raised $8 million around one year ago. This newest round includes participation from existing backers Venturra Capital, SIG, Beenext and Wavemaker, as well as new investors — two angels — Tim Draper and Manik Arora, ex IDG Ventures India head, via his family office fund.
This new funding is being put to work growing Zilingo’s presence in Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia — the region’s largest economy. The startup said it has grown its revenue over 10-fold and added 5,000 new merchants during the past twelve months. It currently ships to eight countries, with seller hubs in Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia, with five company offices.
“A large part of this round is dedicated to growing in Indonesia,” CEO Bose told TechCrunch in an interview. “There’s no other comparable fashion brand, so we probably have a window of about a year to make to big before others follow.”
Zilingo expanded into Indonesia earlier this year after Bose relocated to Jakarta to learn more about the market. Some six months into operating there, she’s impressed by the opportunities of the country.
“I’ve never seen a market that’s so ready to consume consumer internet products,” she said. “We are seeing 85 percent growth each month, that’s not something anyone has seen in other Southeast Asia markets. People spend a bit less on every transaction, but the behavior is crazy and they shop more times.”
“We were initially really worried about logistics, because Indonesia is an archipelago, but it hasn’t been that hard. If your expectations are correctly set, it’s a great market,” the Zilingo CEO added.

Aside from aiming to grow its share of the local market, Zilingo is also making moves overseas. It has just opened a B2B network that will allow fashion sellers in the U.S. and parts of Europe to purchase items direct from Zilingo at a competitive price for local resale.
“There’s demand for that supply outside of Southeast Asia,” Bose said. “If you run a boutique in Europe or America, it’s likely you are procuring products from Asia but there are a lot of middlemen.”
For now though, the primary focus is Southeast Asia at this point.
Bose added that she’s particularly excited to work with Burda, which has emerged as one of the few traditional Series B investors in Southeast Asia after hiring ex-GREE investor Albert Shyy to head up the region.
“These guys bring a whole new perspective on fashion and lifestyle,” she said in reference to Burda’s investment in Etsy and its global media portfolio, which includes brands such as Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, and InStyle.
“It seems only yesterday that Zilingo started with a seed round from Sequoia India and most of the team based out of the Sequoia incubation space in Bangalore. It is terrific to see how they have progressed towards building the leading fashion and lifestyle e-commerce company in Southeast Asia,” said Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia Capital India — another Zilingo backer — in a statement.",2017-09-12,1539151,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/zilingo-ios.jpg?w=738,asia/,"southeast-asia,craftsvilla,california,sequoia-capital",Zilingo raises $18M for its fashion e-commerce service in Southeast Asia,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/zilingo-raises-18m/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Xiaomi is shooting a number of arrows at Apple today. Smartphones aside, it just launched an affordable take on the Macbook Air that ships with Windows.
The first Xiaomi laptop was a shot at the Macbook Air when it was unveiled in the summer of 2016, and the company is back with its take on Apple’s more expensive computer. The Mi Notebook Pro — because all comparisons start with the name — sports a 15.6-inch display and is powered by an Intel Core i7 processor with up to 16GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics chip. That combination makes it an apparent 40 percent times more powerful than the Mi Notebook Air from last year, Xiaomi said.
Elsewhere, the newest machine includes a fingerprint sensor inside the trackpad, three-in-one SD card support, USB-C and regular USB ports, a headphones jack and a full HDMI slot. Xiaomi wasted no time highlighting that this selection offers far more options than the latest in Apple’s own Macbook Pro series.
Last year’s Mi Notebook came in around the 3599 RMB mark, but the Pro version is a little pricier. Models start from 5599 RMB ($858) for an i5 chipset with 8GB. The i7 version comes with 8GB for 3699 RMB ($980) or 16GB for 6999 RMB ($1072).
Release-wise, it looks like another China-only product unless we hear otherwise from Xiaomi.
Those based outside of China can at least take heart in the release of two other devices today that seem certain for global availability. The new and impressive Mi Mix 2 smartphone, and the revamped Mi Note 3 phablet.",2017-09-11,1538669,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mi-notebook-pro-1.jpg?w=738,asia/,"home-automation,computing",Xiaomi takes aim at Apple with a Macbook Pro rival priced from $858,"xiaomi,steve-jobs",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/xiaomi-mi-notebook-pro/
Jon Russell,Asia,"It’s the day before iPhone launch and Xiaomi is back at it again with the unveiling of the follow-up to last year’s highly-acclaimed and near-bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone.
The Mi Mix 2 keeps the previous design aesthetic — developed by a team led by designer Philippe Starck — but with a slightly smaller six-inch display and improved 18:9 screen resolution. The bezel is minimal once again, and the Chinese phone maker claims to have trimmed the lower border down by a significant 12 percent.
It’s a pretty striking look — once again — and it fits with the biggest trend in devices this year, minimizing the bezel in exchange for maximum front screen size. It’s a train that Samsung, LG and (reportedly) Apple have all bordered to help stand out from the rest. Xiaomi went a little further last year when it removed the front speaker to optimize the screen, and it’s the same story this year. Again, it has opted for a piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology setup to minimize the speaker, but this time it actually occupies some space on the device rather than being buried last year, which had caused some audio issues.
There are some notable internal upgrades, including a higher quality camera that uses a Sony IMX386 sensor — bringing it up to par with the Mi 6 — and Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB RAM powering the phone.
The options start at 3299 RMB ($506) for 64 GB of storage, with 3599 RMB ($550) for 128 GB and 3999 RMB ($613) for 256 GB. A special edition model that includes an impressive ceramic unibody and pairs 8GB RAM with 128 GB of storage is on offer for a more pricey 4699 RMB, or around $720.
As it did last year, Xiaomi also used the Mix Mix launch to out its newest Mi Note smartphone.
The Mi Note 3 appeared today a little smaller than before — 5.5-inches — with a Snapdragon 660 processor, 3,500 mAh battery and 6GB RAM. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera and 12-megapixel dual-lens arrangement for the rear-side camera, including 2X optic zoom, portrait mode and four-axis optical image stabilizer (OIS).
The new Mi Note comes in at 2499 RMB ($383) for 64 GB, 2899 RMB ($445) for 128 GB and 2999 RMB ($460) for 128 GB.

These new devices follow the launch last week of Xiaomi’s first stock Android device — the very fine-looking Mi A1 — which falls under Google’s Android One program. These new arrivals today both operate on its MI UI Android software fork, however.
This year has been a period of recovery for Xiaomi, which saw its once-explosive sales growth slacken over the past two years as it came to terms with aggressive rivals in China and the difficult challenge of growing its presence outside of its homeland.
CEO Lei Jun, who declined to disclose annual sales figures for the first time earlier this year, hailed his company’s recovery this summer. Sales in China jumped 60 percent from Q1 2017 to Q2 2017 leading Lei to claim Xiaomi had reached “a major inflection point” in its growth.
“After two years of internal recalibration, Xiaomi is once again embarking on a rapid growth trajectory,” he said in a letter to employees.
With three attractive news devices launched this month alone, Xiaomi will be hoping to build on its promising year as 2017 closes out and 2018 comes along.",2017-09-11,1538645,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mix-max-2-6.jpg?w=738,asia/,"computing,video,technology,ios",Xiaomi unveils second bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone and new Mi Note phablet,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/xiaomi-mi-mix-2-mi-note-3/
Romain Dillet,Asia,"Another day, another crash and another Chinese ban. This time, as Reuters spotted, a single report from financial news site Caixin is saying that the Chinese government is considering banning cryptocurrency exchanges in China.
In particular, the report is saying that Chinese citizens won’t be able to use exchanges to buy bitcoins, ethers and more using Chinese yuan, and vice versa.
Cryptocurrencies aren’t banned per se, just exchanges. But do bitcoins have value in China if you can’t exchange them? That’s the main question and the reason why cryptocurrencies are crashing.
This is what it looks like on coinmarketcap.com right now:

Bitcoin is currently down 7.7 percent, Ethereum is down 11 percent, Bitcoin Cash (which is quite popular in China) is down 11.2 percent, etc. But if you go on Chinese exchanges, the crash is even more important. For instance, Bitcoin is down 13.4 percent and Ethereum is down 18.4 percent on OKCoin.
As always, it’s a bit hard to know for sure what’s going to happen. There’s only a single report about this decision. Chinese investors could be trying to exit cryptocurrency markets as quickly as possible because they risk being locked into cryptocurrencies.
Those exchanges have already been regulated with KYC (know your customer) rules and anti-money laundering rules. Margin trading is also forbidden in China.
Maybe the Chinese government wants even more control and is going to create a centralized exchange and regulate those markets as much as possible. It’s hard to know for sure as Chinese regulation is always very sudden.
Earlier this week, the Chinese government banned ICOs in China. There’s currently an ICO freeze and the top 60 ICO platforms are being investigated. Authorities thought ICO tokens were like securities, and some of them were a scam.
This isn’t the first time China is banning exchanges. Back in 2013, bitcoin dropped more than 50 percent as the government asked BTCChina to stop accepting deposits in Chinese yuan. The government changed its mind later on.",2017-09-08,1537992,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/bitcoin-on-gold1.png?w=738,asia/,"china,cryptocurrency",Bitcoin price drops following report that China is going to shut down local exchanges,bitcoin,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/bitcoin-price-drops-following-report-that-china-is-going-to-shut-down-local-exchanges/
Jon Russell,Asia,"China banned ICOs this week and it is investigating platforms that facilitate them. Over in nearby Japan, one company is hatching an ambitious plan to offer a one-stop-service to let companies across the world take advantage of blockchain technology and IPOs. And all without violating financial regulations.
Tech Bureau currently helps companies with consultancy and a range of technical services, but it is preparing to introduce new platforms to cover nearly every aspect of the process of an ICO, also known as token sales, and chiefly that of raising capital.
The scope of ICO work will span developing the initial white paper (similar to a pre-IPO prospectus), to technical integrations, managing the sale process and even community management and marketing. On the technical side, it already operates its own “mijin” blockchain based on NEM protocol for developers for deployment and “Zaif” bitcoin exchange where coins are sold, so the final piece is facilitating the token sale itself.
The company this week announced that it has raised $15 million from Japan’s largest VC firm JAFCO to kickstart it plans. It previous raised $10 million. The money will be used to put the first building blocks in place, including hiring talent and opening at least four offices worldwide, to develop Japan’s first ICO platform, COMSA, and take advantage of the interest in bitcoin in the country and a boom in crypto currency funding that has already passed $1.7 billion this year.
COMSA will take a different approach to platforms like ICOage and ICO.info in China. The Chinese services were ideal for buyers, offering a one-stop solution to buying into ICOs, and companies selling tokens, since they could almost guarantee that a chunk of the token sale would come from China. With COMSA, Tech Bureau wants to be more selective and tie the sale process into its other services.
“We help implement token/blockchain tech to businesses in a way that businesses can add value to the tokens they issue,” CEO Takao Asayama told TechCrunch. “We will be a catalyst or I would say a conduit between the decentralized public blockchain world and the centralized, legit and working businesses.”
Asayama told TechCrunch that the platform could host 20-30 token sales before the end of next year, all of which will be with “legit and working businesses.” Four are slated to come this year, with crowdfunding site Campfire and public-listed Premium Water Holdings set to go first.
The first step of the process seems Tech Bureau help companies wanting to hold ICOs analyze how they can implement blockchain technology into their business, a critical factor that is often overlooked by the fact that companies can raise considerable amounts by token sales. A genuine integration is one factor that would be used to judge whether a token sale is legitimate, or not. Another — and the big crypto question, being asked by the SEC and other regulators worldwide — is whether the token on offer falls under securities law.
On that subject, Japan has been fairly accommodating to bitcoin as an asset — it is accepted fairly widely by retailers — but, like most other countries, its position on ICOs is less clear, particularly if and when tokens fall under securities laws.
That doesn’t concern Tech Bureau, because the company does extensive diligence and already provides advice around whether a token sale structure might fall under the jurisdiction of financial regulators.
“As long as you handle only non-security tokens, it is ok,” explained Asayama. “Once it circulates in the market, it becomes virtual currency. We help implement token/blockchain tech to businesses that way they can add value to the tokens they issue.”
The plan is to take the model global — in terms of both token issuers and token buyers — and already 50 percent of inbound interest for ICO companies is from outside of Japan, Asayama said. Given the international scope, some level of risk management will be implemented with users. Those based in China, for one, are likely to be excluded from the COMSA platform.
While the platform is still being developed, Tech Bureau has already attracted 150,000 registered users who, once it is online, will be able to invest in ICOs hosted on COMSA. One key component to attracting that audience is COMSA’s own ICO.
Yes, of course the platform that will host ICOs is running its own ICO first!
Asayama said that the VC cash will go towards constructing the business, and hiring, but its own ICO will fund the development of the COMSA platform and other blockchain-based services that for integration
The plan is to raise money through an uncapped sale to registered COMSA users following an initial $10 million pre-sale to major investors. Asayama said the sale would uncapped to prevent so-called ‘pump and dump’ strategies from investors who get into a closed cap sale and release a token into the market at a higher price once it is generally available to all.
“We consider this a platform not a one-time token sale,” he explained. “And we have confidence of ongoing growth in value of the CMS token.”
He said an ideal sale would raise upwards of $50 million. The token sale itself will run from October 2 to November 6, according to details on the dedicated website.
Token ownership will include a number of benefits, including decisive votes on potential COMSA projects.
“If there are some challenging businesses coming along with certain risk, we can take community vote, based on the number of our tokens they own. The community can decide if they want that business to go ICO or not,” Asayama explained.
Experts have warned that China’s ICO ban could allow other global markets to take the lead on token sales, and it looks like that’s exactly the objective here.
“With a foresighted approach, Japan appears to be taking the lead in managing the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. Major venture capital companies are pouring in money, and the industry is well on its way to becoming a major economic force,” said Lon Wong, President of the NEM.io Foundation which has collaborated with Tech Bureau.

Jon Russell,Asia,"UrWork, the unicorn that is competing with WeWork in China, is following its American rival’s lead by extending its reach in Southeast Asia after it took part in a $3 million funding round for Indonesia-based ReWork.
The round, which is described as pre-Series A, was led by China-U.S. firm ATM Capital and Indonesia’s Convergence Ventures. UrWork was a participant alongside U.S. firm Social Capital (which is increasingly active at Indonesia), Fortune Union Investments, ACE Capital and other undisclosed backers.
UrWork is valued at $1.5 billion following recent financing. It has 88 locations in 22 cities in its native China, but it is planning an aggressive overseas expansion into 32 cities worldwide over the next three years. That’s just as WeWork doubles down on China, where it recently launched a local business that is aimed at rapidly growing the eight spaces it currently operates across the Greater China region.
Just as we have witnessed Chinese tech firms moving rapidly into Southeast Asia to grab a slice of the fast-growing startup ecosystem, so the co-working unicorns have taken aim at the region, and Indonesia — its largest economy — in particular.
WeWork expanded into Southeast Asia via the acquisition of Singapore-based SpaceMob, and it has set aside a budget of $500 million to grow in Southeast Asia, which houses over 600 million people.
Already, UrWork has a location in Southeast Asia via Singapore in addition to a presence in the U.S., but now it is looking to expand into Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, through this deal.
“Southeast Asia’s economy and technology market are extremely promising with huge growth potential for both local ventures and for China based businesses. We see it as a very strategic destination and are working with Rework to further open up the market and support local and overseas companies grow through the development of collaborative work spaces,” Mao Da Qing, who is CEO and founder URWork, told TechCrunch in a statement.
ReWork founder and CEO Vanessa Hendriadi told TechCrunch that UrWork’s strategic investment will give leverage for future alliances with clients and retail estate partners. While of course UrWork will help with its experience and know-how.
“UrWork was very impressed with the ecosystem, the companies they met and the country in general” after first visiting Indonesia last year, Hendriadi said in an interview. “The deal is very timely, they’d just finished their funding round, became a unicorn, opened up in Singapore and are keen to expand in Southeast Asia.”
Unlike WeWork-Spacemob, there’s been no talk of an outright buy-out of ReWork, according to Hendriadi.
“Right now, the partnership goes around exchange of resources,” she explained, adding that the two companies’ technologies and apps will be integrated in the near future. “We can be the landing platform for Chinese companies wanting to come to Indonesia and be plugged into the ecosystem.”

ReWork currently operates two locations in Indonesian capital Jakarta, a city with over 10 million inhabitants that’s known as a global social media hotspot. The startup is planning to add another four locations in Jakarta over the next six months, before moving to other major urban areas, including Bali and Bandung. There’s no immediate plan for regional expansion, but the it is looking at possible moves into the Philippines and Malaysia next year.
Business-model wise, ReWork typically works with property owners on a revenue-share basis, but, as it eyes more rapid expansion, it is in talks with larger real estate companies over joint ventures that could add multiple spaces to its presence in one go, Hendriadi said.
It’s also taken an interesting twist on expanding via a tie-up with commercial property group Ismaya. That deal will see small ReWork outposts opened alongside Ismaya locations, which include shopping malls and office buildings, to give members more flexibility with work options and help reach new demographics.
Echoing others in the co-working industry in Asia, including aggregator FlySpaces, Hendriadi said the main meat of the business is in established companies and corporates, rather than digital nomads or small teams — although they are also catered to. She believes the current system is seriously lacking, and that’s the gap ReWork aims to plug.
“Traditional serviced offices are very soul-less with very small shared facilities,” the ReWork CEO said. “All you want to do is go to your office and close the door, but sometimes it doesn’t even have windows!”

It’s going to get interesting when WeWork moves into Indonesia via SpaceMob, which is working on entering the country, while Naked, another massive competitor to WeWork from China, is also casting glances at Southeast Asia.
For now, ReWork — and UrWork — have the advantage, and investors seem impressed.

We’re excited to support her on this next stage of rapid expansion and growth,” Social Capital’s Ashley Carroll said in a statement.",2017-09-07,1537796,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/rework1.jpeg?w=567,asia/,"china,asia,southeast-asia,indonesia",China’s UrWork invests in Indonesia’s ReWork via $3M deal as WeWork rivalry heats up,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/iwork-uwork-wework-rework-urwork/
Jon Russell,Asia,"India-based OYO, a startup that pioneered and popularized the concept of budget hotel networks, has closed $250 million in new funding led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund.
The startup was founded in 2013 by Thiel Fellow Ritesh Agarwal, now aged 24, and the concept centers around standardizing the quality of India’s wildly differentiated affordable hotels, and providing some structure to make bookings simple and customer service simplified.
The answer is an app-based service that lets customers book hotels and manage their experience through their smartphone. Not just that but it also provides basic guarantees of service.
Being sure that you’ll get hot water, clean sheets, WiFi and a responsive concierge might not sound a lot, but they’ll give the average traveler piece of mind as anyone who has ever navigated India or other Asian emerging markets can testify to. Likewise, with prices of under 1,000 INR ($15.60), rooms are more affordable than many nationwide hotels while providing common quality.
OYO’s newest round is led by Vision Fund, the hugely ambitious $100 billion global fund led by SoftBank, which invested in OYO previously. It includes participation from existing backers Sequoia India, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Greenoaks Capital, while Hero Enterprise, an ambitious fund attached to motorbike and scooter maker Hero MotoCorp, joined as a new investor.
This new Series D round means that OYO has now raised $436 million from investors to date. The startup said it plans to use the capital to grow its reach in India, and expand its presence overseas.
As of now, OYO’s network spans 230 cities across India, Malaysia and Nepal, offering over 70,000 rooms in India alone. The company said it is getting close to growing its capacity at a rate of 10,000 rooms per month, and it plans to push on into more rural parts of India and move into additional overseas markets, too, although it isn’t being precise on which ones right now.
Its first overseas foray was Malaysia in early 2016 and, while it added Nepal in April of this year, that was some while ago. Perhaps the added competition in India, particular that of key rival Treebo, have kept it busy? Treebo just announced a $45 million round of its own last week, and it has been busy investing in TV ads to grow its brand, so the timing of this new OYO raise is particularly noteworthy.

In a statement, OYO CEO Agarwal said he also intends to invest in technology and improving the customer experience.
One area where it is diversifying out is with the younger generation. OYO launched millennial-focused brand Townhouse — “your friendly neighborhood hotel” that also serves as a breakfast/co-working venue — in January. Agarwal suggested that the product, which is aimed at the mid-market audience with prices upwards of 3,500 INR ($55), will be expanded nationwide after a promising start to life.
“OYO has solidified its position in India as the leading accommodation brand for consumer affordability and high quality standards.

Jon Russell,Apps,"Chatbots may have underwhelmed thus far, but the impact of the technology still has bags of potential in international markets where mobile messaging has been mainstream for years.
That’s the view of one startup that’s working to bring the benefit of bots to the mainstream in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and the largest economy in the growing region of Southeast Asia.
Indonesia has been recognized as a global hotspot for social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in recent years, and messaging app adoption has been equally as strong with Line, Kakao, BlackBerry BBM and WhatsApp among the top choices for the country’s 260 million population.
Kata.ai, a Jakarta-based startup that recently raised $3 million, said it sees huge potential for many industries and segments to tap into the culture of chat to advance their business and customer relations. It operates a platform that lets brands and companies to operate chatbots using the native Bahasa Indonesian language, and not English which is not widely spoken with fluency.
“We are helping brands to provide better engagement, sell stuff and open new revenue generation channels,” Irzan Raditya, CEO of parent company YesBoss Group. “Chat already has a foothold in Indonesia, but now we want to demystify AI and open up other technologies to underserved markets.”
Right now, Kata.ai operates on a number of chat platforms, which include Facebook Messenger, Line, Telegram, Slack and BBM (which is still big in Indonesia), as well as Twitter and Skype.
WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app, is a conspicuous absentee because the company has not yet opened its platform. However, that could change soon with this week’s announcement of plans to integrate business services into the app soon.
YesBoss Group began as a personal assistant service, but it pivoted into chatbots when Raditya noticed that the only solutions were global — and therefore in English — which could only ever have limited impact in markets like Indonesia. He then went ahead and started the first local platform for bots.

Mobile operator Telkomsel is one of the startup’s most visible clients today, using its platform to power its own-name chat bot that lets customers top-up their balance, change packages and check other information. The company plans to use this new funding — led by Taiwan’s Trans-Pacific Technology Fund — to push business-wise by creating its own in-house sales team. The core tech itself needs development and so a significant portion of the round will go towards hiring the AI and big data talent required.
That’s a tough ask in Indonesia where, despite a large population, there’s a lack of tech talent and particularly individuals with experience in AI and chatbot-related fields. For now, though, Raditya isn’t thinking of opening overseas offices to suck up talent, instead he’s looking locally and for those willing to move (or return) to Indonesia.
Likewise, there’s no immediate expansion plan, but he did suggest that the Kata.ai service will launch in new markets in Southeast Asia at some point next year. But with Indonesia forecast to account for half of the region’s fast-growing internet economy, the startup is at least starting out at ground zero.",2017-09-06,1536577,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/tsel-veronika-promo.jpg?w=738,asia/,"southeast-asia,indonesia,chatbot",Chatbot startup founder sees Southeast Asia potential despite slow start worldwide,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/chatbot-startup-founder-sees-southeast-asia-potential/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Event Pop, a two-year-old digital ticketing startup from Thailand, has raised a Series A round of over $2 million to expand its product and move into new markets.
The round was led by Thai investors InVent, a subsidiary of the parent of operator AIS, and Kasikorn Bank’s $30 million Beacon fund. Event Pop had previously raised $500,000. One of its backers is millionaire businessman Ittipat “Tob” Peeradechapan, who owns seaweed snack company Tao Kae Noi, and it has unnamed investors in Japan.
Event Pop helps event organizers with their ticketing and marketing efforts. It services include access control, cashless payments, data collection and management, and monitoring and analytics. To date, it has handled over 3,000 events, which it said includes gigs, festivals, live shows, sports and businesses seminars.
Beyond a website, its mobile app goes beyond finding and booking events to act as an entry ticket and, in some cases, a method to make cashless payments when at the event itself using NFC. (No more fiddling for cash at a gig.)
Event Pop CEO Pattaraporn “Max” Bodhisuwan told TechCrunch that the plan is to invest in new areas for services, and look into the potential to expand to parts of Southeast Asia and East Asia.
Bodhisuwan isn’t saying too much about the countries just yet, but you’d imagine that Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is on the list.
In terms of product, Event Pop has already gone beyond ticketing after adding in-event payments. Bodhisuwan said it will look at more features for festivals, sporting events and businesses to help event organizers and attendees get more both during the events themselves and outside of them, too.
A regional expansion would pit Event Pop against other ticketing companies that include Japan’s Peatix, Singapore-based EventNook and global players like Eventbrite.

Jon Russell,Asia,"One day after China’s decision to ban ICOs pending an investigation, Hong Kong — the country that is a special administrative region of China — has voiced concern at the growth of ICO fundraising.
ICOs, which involve the sale of newly issued crypto coins to raise money, are said to have brought in $1.6 billion in funding for companies so far this year, according to crypto industry website CoinDesk’s analytics. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimated that more money was raised in the first half of 2017 by ICOs than early stage VC firms.
Despite some promising projects, there is widespread concern around the accountability of all ICO projects and the potential for scams, money laundering and other illicit activity.
“We are concerned about an increase in the use of ICOs to raise funds in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Those involved in an ICO need to be aware that some ICO structures may be subject to Hong Kong securities laws,” Julia Leung of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement.
While Leung and her colleagues may be concerned, the SFC — which regulates Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets — isn’t dropping the hammer as China’s central bank did with its decision to immediately suspend ICOs and investigate around 60 companies that facilitate them.
Instead, the Hong Kong-based body has warned those who take part in ICOs, which are also known as token sales, that they may be in breach of laws if what they sell is a security. Whether ICO tokens are a security is a million billion dollar question in itself. The SEC in the U.S. and Singapore’s MAS are among other regulators to have warned those involved in ICOs of securities laws which they may be violating.
The SFC also clarified that the regulations don’t simply apply to Hong Kong-based companies holding ICOs, but any entity worldwide that sells tokens to individuals based in Hong Kong.
Regulatory concern has already prompted many companies to exclude citizens based in the U.S. and Singapore from token sales, and concerns from today’s memo may lead to others that are contemplating an ICO to add Hong Kong to that exclusion list.
That’s significant because not only is Hong Kong a major global financial hub, but it retains considerable business links with China, particularly around investment. You’d imagine, then, that today’s statement was triggered by yesterday’s China ban.
Korea is another worry for ICO companies after its financial regulator issued a crackdown that was also announced this week.
Here’s the full statement from the SFC:",2017-09-05,1535981,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hong-kong.jpg?w=738,asia/,"icos,hong-kong",Hong Kong regulator ‘concerned’ by ICO funding boom,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/hong-kong-ico-concern/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Xiaomi’s bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone grabbed a huge amount of attention when it launched last October. Now the Chinese phone maker is getting more opportunistic with the follow-up version, which it plans to unveil at an event in Beijing one day before Apple’s iPhone launch.
The timing is perfect for Xiaomi. Its last device was a smash and there’s huge expectations on the next iPhone.
All eyes will be on Apple, which needs to release a device that distinguishes itself from the past few tick-tock iterations to boost its brand and shore up falling sales in China. From what we’ve seen so far from leaks, it appears that the next iPhone will include some radical changes, but in launching a day prior, Xiaomi will take the spotlight for 24 hours and lay the ground for direction comparisons with Apple’s next flagship.
The Mi Mix was a hit beyond Xiaomi’s usual pool of fans thanks to a stunning front design which is nearly all screen and very little bezel.

At the time that was a serious breakthrough — Xiaomi initially billed the Mi Mix as a concept device — but now screens are the hot topic for smartphones in 2017. LG and Samsung have unveiled devices with minimal bezels, running with the Mi Mix’s design lead, so naturally there’s plenty of anticipation over what Xiaomi has up its sleeve for the follow-up model.
Early leaks suggest an even smaller bezel — well of course! — with Qualcomm as-yet-announced Snapdragon 836 chipset and support for Android 8.0 Oreo off the bat.
Xiaomi isn’t saying too much for now… because why spoil the event when you’ve set it up so nicely.
2017 has been a much better year for Xiaomi after it had struggled to maintain heady growth of its early days over the last two years.
CEO Lei Jun admitted that Xiaomi had grown too fast when looking at its 2016 results, but this year it seems to have found its rhythm with impressive sales growth and a recent $1 billion loan to put the focus back on its international growth, which had stalled in recent times with little sign of success outside of China.
In that respect, the Mi Mix launch timing is ideal for Xiaomi. Now we wait until September 11 to see what comes next.",2017-09-04,1535671,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mi-mix.jpeg?w=738,asia/,"ios,apple-inc,iphone",Xiaomi aims to upstage the iPhone with successor to acclaimed bezel-less smartphone,xiaomi,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/xiaomi-mi-mix-apple-iphone-upstage/
Jon Russell,Asia,"It is looking like a new era is coming for ICOs, at least those in China for now. In the U.S., the SEC has issued official warnings around the risks of ICOs, also known as token sales, but the Chinese government looks set to beat it to implementing regulation around the rapidly growing fundraising option.
A notice from a committee led by China’s central bank [link in Chinese] today announced an immediate ban on ICO funding, which has “seriously disrupted the economic and financial order.”
Financial news site Caixin reported [link in Chinese] reported that the committee has prepared a list of 60 exchanges which will be subject to inspection and a report. In the meantime, there will be an ICO freeze in China.
ICOs involve raising funding by creating and selling new crypto tokens — commonly based on Ethereum — to investors. That’s led to comparisons with securities, with much speculation over whether financial regulators will look to regulate the space.
The Chinese committee voiced concern that some ICOs are financial scams and pyramid schemes. That echoes a recent warning from Singapore’s MAS.
“ICOs are vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, and the ease with which large sums of monies may be raised in a short period of time,” MAS, Singapore’s central bank, said in an August 1 statement.
It isn’t clearly exactly which companies are on the committee’s investigation list, but already two of China’s largest platforms for buying into ICOs — ICOage and ICO.info, which help connect companies selling tokens with buyers — have suspended their services and stopped taking on new projects. Both said their suspensions were voluntary.
The number of ICOs hosted this year has risen massively across the world. The total amount raised from token sales surpassed early stage investment spending from traditional venture capitals during the first half of 2017, according to a Goldman Sachs report.
This year to date, ICO fundraising is said to have topped $1.6 billion. Already, two companies’ coins have grown to a market cap of more than $1 billion, although the significance of that landmark is unclear since neither has a product in the market right now.
China, which houses one of the world’s most active bitcoin communities, has been a key part of the ICO boom, both in terms of companies selling tokens and buyers snapping them up.
State media firm Xinhua reported in July that Chinese companies had raised $383 million from 105,000 investors during the first half of the year.
The SEC hasn’t made a firm move in the U.S. yet — despite making announcements — so all eyes will be on China to see what kind of mechanisms can govern ICOs, and indeed whether all types of ICOs will be regulated. It’ll also be interesting to watch the potential fall out of this crackdown on the market for ICOs, and crypto currencies generally, given the prominent role played by China.
Long-time crypto watchers will recall 2013, when China banned exchanges from allowing people to buy into bitcoin and other crypto coins using the local yuan currency. The result was a huge price drop, but support for yuan deposits did return and the price if bitcoin has soared to new highs — most recently $5,000 on some exchanges.",2017-09-04,1535660,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/shutterstock_325058183.jpg?w=738,asia/,"icos,initial-coin-offering,china",China has banned ICOs,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/chinas-central-bank-has-banned-icos/
Jon Russell,Asia,"At our TechCrunch China event in June we discussed the bright future that Hong Kong’s startup scene has, despite some big challenges. This week the country passed a notable milestone as it got its first $1 billion valued startup, better known as a unicorn.
The company in question is GoGoVan, a logistics on-demand provider that connects van drivers and customers for transporting goods. GoGoVan and others like it, including fellow Hong Kong company Lalamove, are often labeled as ‘Uber for delivery,’ but most customers are from the business world.
GoGoVan has passed the $1 billion mark precisely because it is looking to go beyond the B2B market. It has merged with China-based 58 Suyun, a fellow logistics on-demand platform that is focused on serving consumers.
Beyond the strategy of marrying a business-focused service with a consumer-focused offering, the deal is also complementary in terms of geographies. 58 Suyun — which is owned by online classifieds giant 58.com — is present in over 100 cities in China with 1.2 million registered drivers, while GoGoVan is present in eight cities in China as well as China, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and India.
The merged entity — which will be called GoGoVan — plans to integrate the two businesses together to offer GoGoVan services in 58 Suyun’s locations, and bring 58 Suyun’s services outside of China. The newly formed company has a valuation of over $1 billion, its CEO Steven Lam told TechCrunch in an interview.
“This deal make perfect sense for both sides,” Lam said. “We have Southeast Asia and China with a B2b focus, and that’s completely different from 58, which is in the consumer market. We have a leadership position in China and in some countries in Southeast Asia — we can do much more in Southeast Asia and beyond.”

There is also a common investor. Alibaba invested in GoGoVan via its entrepreneurship fund, and it backed 58.com’s 58 Home subsidiary, which operates 58 Suyun, in a $300 million round in 2015. GoGoVan, which was started in 2014 by five Hong Kong founders, has raised over $26 million from investors although its most recent Series C was undisclosed.
Lam said that post deal the company is looking to raise upwards of $200 million for expansion into two or three new markets next year. In 2019, he wants to move beyond Asia, perhaps into Australia and Europe, and list the company on a public market.
“The plan is to make sure the company is ready to be listed, but it depends on the market situation. If we can be really profitable, we may even stay private,” Lam explained. He added that Hong Kong, which has seen a growth in interest from tech companies, could be the IPO destination, but GoGoVan is open to a U.S. listing, too.
GoGoVan isn’t alone with this ambition. Lalamove is also beginning to explore opportunities to go public, too. It raised $30 million from investors earlier this year and its head of international suggested it will look to hold an IPO, most likely in Hong Kong, before 2020.",2017-09-01,1535500,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gogovan4.jpg?w=738,asia/,"gogovan,hong-kong,unicorn",GoGoVan becomes Hong Kong’s first $1 billion startup following merger deal,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/gogovan-becomes-hong-kongs-first-1-billion-startup-following-merger-deal/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Treebo Hotels, one of the most prominent members of India’s emerging budget hotel networks, has closed a $34 million Series C round.
The deal was led by new backers Ward Ferry Management and Karst Peak Capital, two Hong Kong PE firms, with participation from existing investors SAIF Partners, Matrix Partners India and Bertelsmann India Investments. Before this deal, two-year-old Treebo had raised $23 million, including its $17 million Series B last year.
Startups like Treebo and OYO, which has raised over $250 million from investors like SoftBank and Sequoia, have sprouted up to offer a tech-enabled response to the problem of vastly differing quality of hotels across India.
They propose a base standard for guests which includes clean linen, bedding, free WiFi and more, for a price range of 1,000-3,000 INR, or roughly $15-$50, per night. In addition, they use a mobile app as a virtual concierge service to help with check-in, orders, answer questions and more.
The idea is to set standards where none exist. That might not sound all that impressive in a Western context, but anyone who has traveled in India, or other parts of Asia, can attest to the peace of mind that these guarantees can give.
Treebo claims to offer nearly 300 hotels (covering over 6,000 rooms) in more than 50 cities in India. Unlike OYO, it hasn’t ventured overseas. Co-founder Rahul Chaudhary told TechCrunch last year that the India opportunity is a large enough challenge to tackle. He estimates that budget hotels represent 65 percent of the national hotel market, which means roughly $15-20 billion in spend per year.
The company does differentiate from the competition slightly with its approach. Treebo operates a full franchise model which means it takes on hotels exclusively, working with hotel owners to provide its branding, customer acquisition channels, management software and more. In exchange, it takes a revenue cut that can be as high as 40 percent.
OYO and others operate partial inventory, allowing some rooms at a hotel to be unlisted or available via other platforms. However, they have begun to move in the same direction as Treebo. Earlier this year, OYO said it had 30,000 rooms under full inventory, but it isn’t clear what portion of its total reach that is.
Treebo said it plans to spend the new capital on improving its customer experience, marketing, tech and expansions. This year it began using TV advertising, with high-profile actor Irrfan Khan its ambassador, to grow among new audiences. We can likely expect more of the same thanks to this new war chest of cash.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Thailand’s banks have stepped up to chase the startup dream over the past year. Following on from SCB’s Digital Ventures, which has backed blockchain startup Ripple among others, Kasikorn Bank (KBank) has made the first investment from its $30 million fund — a $1.15 million round for Bangkok-based FlowAccount.
KBank announced its Beacon fund this summer. It has made investments into funds as an LP, most notably it is involved in Singapore’s Dymon Asia, but this is its first direct investment in a startup.
The bank was joined in the round by Japan-based conglomerate SBI Group, and FlowAccount’s seed investors 500 Startups and Golden Gate Ventures.
FlowAccount is a cloud-based platform for business accounting. It plans to use these new funds to grow its team of 20, and develop new products that extend its reach from cloud-based accounting systems into other SME services. This week, it launched a solution for accounting firms themselves, and it is planning payroll and other HR services for small businesses.
Initially, it is keeping its focus on Thailand, CEO and co-founder Kridsada ‘Gideon’ Chutinaton told TechCrunch in an interview.
“For this round we are still focused locally, we want to be the go-to for small businesses in Thailand,” he said. “We believe the domestic market is still large enough to be a one-county play for the immediate future. When we capture the Thai market then we can begin to look overseas.”
Indeed, snagging Kasikorn Bank (KBank) and SBI as partners can help achieve both of those ends. Chutinaton said KBank has begun some integrations between the FlowAccount service and its SME offerings, while it could heavily promote the service to its customer base — which include the largest share of SMEs for any Thai bank.
SBI, meanwhile, has extensive experience working with SME-focused startups in its native Japan, including freee. Chutinaton said SBI’s involvement can help prime FlowAccount for large funding rounds and an international push when the time is right.
For now his goal is to help SMEs in Thailand, and the wider Southeast Asia area, bring the benefits of the internet and the cloud to their operations.
“Local players building local solutions for countries is really valuable,” he explained, noting that most global services aren’t suited to small businesses operating in Southeast Asia. “It may not appeal to a global audience but it impacts local people and that’s worth doing.”
“Adoption for Saas on a subscription service basis is still very new here and we’re helping companies take that step from processing information offline to doing it online.

Megan Rose Dickey,Startups,"GrubHub was back in court today in San Francisco over its use of 1099 independent contractors for food delivery. Tj O’Shae, a former GrubHub W-2 employee who worked as a driver care representative from September 2015 to February 2016, echoed much of what plaintiff Raef Lawson testified.
She spoke about preferred drivers getting access to priority scheduling, acceptance rates, bonuses and a system that allowed GrubHub to see where their drivers were — even if they weren’t on a specific delivery — and “ghost orders.”
But before O’Shae took the stand, Lawson faced cross-examination by Michele Maryott, a lawyer for GrubHub.
“You talked about the ghost orders and your claim you didn’t receive orders,” Maryott said. “You were making that up, weren’t you?”
“No,” Lawson replied.
GrubHub says ghost orders are not and were not a thing. Maryott referenced how GrubHub at one point told Lawson there was no such thing as a ghost order and then gave him tips on how to avoid missing delivery opportunities.
Maryott also mentioned that it was possible those glitches happened because there was something wrong with Lawson’s phone, which he provided himself, rather than something wrong with GrubHub. Lawson said that was a possibility.
But O’Shae’s testimony suggests Lawson was not the only driver who experienced ghost orders.
“Drivers complained about ghost orders all the time,” O’Shae said.
So-called ghost orders are a miscommunication between the computer system and the driver’s device, O’Shae said. It results in drivers not noticing that they received a delivery request, which negatively affects their order acceptance rate. And a low acceptance rate means no access to priority scheduling.
The reason priority scheduling matters is because Los Angeles, where Lawson drove for GrubHub, “was one of the most competitive markets for shifts that we had,” O’Shae said in her testimony. Drivers would describe the process to get shifts as a “mad scramble,” she added.
With these alleged ghost orders affecting the acceptance rate of drivers, Lawson’s lawyer, Shannon Liss-Riordan, believes GrubHub used “ghost orders” to keep drivers “on their toes,” she said earlier in the week. By allegedly keeping drivers on their toes, the drivers would in theory be more inclined to accept every order they received. Liss-Riordan is trying to prove that GrubHub had a certain amount of control over its drivers, which is a primary factor in the Borello test.
The Borello test looks at circumstances like whether the work is part of the company’s regular business, the skill required, payment method and whether the work is done under supervision of a manager. The purpose of the test is to determine whether a worker is a 1099 contractor or a W-2 employee.
I’ll be back in court tomorrow morning to hear testimony from GrubHub COO Stan Chia, who is expected to discuss the part of GrubHub’s business that relates to drivers, and hear some cross-examination of O’Shae.",2017-09-07,1537294,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-634145860.jpg?w=738,startups/,"1099-economy,sharing-economy,grubhub-trial,grubhub",Former GrubHub employee testified drivers often complained about ‘ghost orders’,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/former-grubhub-employee-testimony-ghost-orders/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"French startup Streamroot just raised $3.2 million from Partech Ventures, Techstars Venture Capital Fund, Verizon Ventures* and R/GA. The company is taking advantage of WebRTC to make video streaming much cheaper.
When you’re watching a video on YouTube or Netflix, those companies send a video file to your device from their servers. It’s a straightforward, one-way transaction between a data center and your device. That’s why tech companies spend a ton of money on bandwidth because video files are heavy.
Streamroot wants to change this model by adding a peer-to-peer layer. Companies like Dailymotion, Canal+, Eurosport and Russia Today have been using Streamroot’s technology so that not all videos come from their servers.
Let’s say you’re watching Taylor Swift’s latest music video on Dailymotion. As Taylor Swift is quite popular, chances are a bunch of people are already watching her video at the same time. Streamroot is going to download part or all of her video from another user directly.
So Dailymotion can deliver 2 different views without sending the file twice from its own servers. It works particularly well for big spikes of traffic on the same video.
The best part is that it’s completely transparent for the user. You don’t have to install anything as most modern web browsers support WebRTC’s most advanced features on desktop and mobile. And if you’re watching an obscure video, Streamroot will just tell your browser to look for the video on a traditional server. It’s the best of both worlds

Jordan Crook,Apps,"HotelTonight, the platform that lets you make last-minute bookings at hotels, is today announcing that they’re expanding their reservation to up to 100 days out. The change doesn’t take effect immediately, but HotelTonight says that the expanded booking window will go live “in the fall.”
As it stands now, HotelTonight only lets users book hotels within seven days of booking date. In other words, the latest that I could book today is for a check-in date one week from now.
The San Francisco-based startup has been through its share of bumps along the way, cutting 20 percent of its workforce in 2015 and going through a period of cutting costs to slow down its burn rate.
But HT CEO Sam Shank told Reuters that the company has turned a new leaf and indeed begun earning a profit. But in a world where Expedia and Booking.com and Priceline are dominating the market, a profit that comes from a sliver of a pie isn’t enough.
That’s why HotelTonight is getting in the ring with the big players with this forthcoming launch of expanded booking windows. That said, it’s unclear how price will be affected by a longer booking window, as part of the reason that HotelTonight can deliver discounts is based on their ability to fill unreserved rooms.
HotelTonight has raised a total of $117 million to date, and serves more than 25,000 hotels in approximately 1,700 cities.",2017-09-07,1537262,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/p1050389.jpg?w=738,startups/,"sam-shank,hoteltonight",HotelTonight to expand booking window to 100 days,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/hoteltonight-to-expand-booking-window-to-100-days/
Fitz Tepper,Apps,"StatMuse, the sports statistics database that can be queried using natural language inquiries, just announced that it’s become the second startup accepted into the NFL Players Association’s accelerator.
As a refresher the accelerator, called The One Team Collective, was built to help smaller startups get access to player licensing rights in return for equity.
We first wrote about Statmuse when it was accepted into Disney’s accelerator in 2015, then again when it raised a $10M Series A early last year. Back then the startup was pretty focused on providing users with helpful graphs and charts that could be pulled up by typing in a question like “most points scored by an NFL team this year”. But soon after raising their Series A, the startup decided to shift its focus to voice apps.
So today Statmuse is launching its own iOS App with an Alexa app coming soon, where you can access its database and ask questions with your voice – and have them answered by your favorite NFL player.

Here’s how it works. The company did recording sessions with dozens of NFL players and legends – ranging from Payton Manning to Jerry Rice. These players spent about 90 minutes recording a range of phrases, which StatMuse then strings into complete sentences on the fly when generating a response.  The startup also has players record different verb combinations and styles of the same word, so the algorithm sound more realistic by saying the same thing in a few different ways.
Right now there are 7 players launching, and the startup hopes to add about one a week going forward. This means that players won’t answer every question – they’ll only respond to ones about them or their team. For general sports inquiries StatMuse enlisted Scott Van Pelt of ESPN, who spend nearly 10 hours recording a much broader catalogue of phrases and player names from the sports world, meaning his voice can respond to basically any question that StatMuse’s database can handle.
The technology isn’t perfect – some of the pauses between words are a bit awkward – making it clear that some phrases is being stitched together on the fly. But this is the exception, and on the whole most responses sound pretty good. Sure, GPS services like Waze have already added voice recordings of celebrities, but its a different experience hearing them respond to a question that you ask with your voice.
The app is totally free to use, but going forward StatMuse sees a trend towards small dollar consumer subscriptions – meaning they may charge a dollar or two a month to talk to your favorite player.
You can check out StatMuse in the iOS App Store now, and on Alexa devices in the next few days.

Anthony Ha,Advertising Tech,"Pendo helps businesses understand and assist their customers with tools like analytics, polls and walkthroughs. Until now, however, CEO Todd Olson said the company has been focused on the web (both desktop and mobile), with just a single mobile developer on the team.
“We as a team constantly had a lot of internal debates about how much to invest in [mobile],” he said. “If you want to do it, you have to really invest in it.”
That’s why the company has made its first acquisition — it’s buying Insert, a mobile marketing startup based in Israel. Olson told me that he connected with Insert through Battery Ventures, which backed both companies, and he saw their product as doing “essentially what we do, but for mobile devices.”
There are some differences, he acknowledged, since Insert is more focused on mobile messaging and less on analytics. But in Olson’s view, the Insert team has already done “all the hard work” of creating a platform that marketers and product designers can use, and integrating that product with native mobile apps.
“The key is doing it without developers,” he said. So with Insert, Pendo can build a platform that allows teams to engage with customers and improve their product across devices, and to do so without developer assistance: “The vision is to combine the products into one simple platform.”
Pendo recently raised a $25 million Series C, partly to fund acquisitions and international expansion — it looks like the Insert deal covers both. (Insert’s Tel Aviv office will also become Pendo’s first international location.) Insert, meanwhile, raised a $10 million round from Battery last year.
The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Olson said the combined companies have a headcount of 145 employees.
“With Insert, Pendo acquires a team that shares its passion for great product experiences,” said Insert founder and CEO Shahar Kaminitz in the acquisition announcement. “This combined platform allows product teams to better understand mobile users and deliver personalized experiences on the right mobile moments, when users are likely to get the best value.”",2017-09-07,1537220,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/pendo-office.jpg?w=738,startups/,"battery-ventures,insert,pendo",Pendo acquires Insert to add mobile apps to its user analytics and engagement platform,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/pendo-acquires-insert/
Jordan Crook,Apps,"The on-demand economy is great for consumers but hard for the companies that provide on-demand services. While many are still struggling to stabilize their business model and optimize their work force, Favor has seemed to find a bit of success by focusing in on a specific region.
Favor is an on-demand delivery service that operates in Texas. Much like Postmates, the service lets users order food (as well as other stuff) from their favorite restaurants and has runners pick it up and deliver it to the end-user.
The company has today announced the close of a $22 million Series B financing round led by existing investor S3 Ventures. Moreover, Favor says that the company has achieved profitability (overall profitability; not unit-economic profitability) as of this year.
Part of that has to do with the way that Favor has scaled back and focused on growing up a small number of markets.
Favor came on to the scene at SXSW in 2014, and took the same approach that most on-demand services do, which is to rapidly expand to new markets. However, Favor announced in July 2016 that it would be shuttering service across five major markets — Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC — and shifting focus to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, instead.
The plan was to target markets with low density but high population, and it worked for a while. But the company has now drawn back into its home state of Texas, serving 11 markets within the state.
CEO Jag Bath sees Texas as a great place to learn how to grow up a market. After all, Texas has the second-largest economy of any state in the country, with a GDP greater than that of many countries.
As part of the funding deal, Favor is bringing on 25,000 new runners and working out a plan to expand to more markets within Texas. Eventually, Bath tells TechCrunch, the company will proceed outside of the state of Texas, but for now they’re working on making Favor as strong as possible in Texas.
Speaking of, Favor has mobilized its workforce to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey, and built out tools offering users the option to donate a care package of relief supplies or make a monetary donation.
Like most on-demand delivery companies, Favor makes a portion of its revenue from its delivery fee, which it splits with the runner — runners keep 100 percent of their tips. But, beyond that, Favor also has paid partnership deals with businesses and restaurants, taking a percentage of the business they bring in for those partners.
“Our biggest challenge is to continue to win on service against many competitors who have deeper pockets and raised a lot of funding,” said Bath. “We don’t try to buy customers or runners, but instead try to provide the best possible service. It’s difficult to compete with free food all the time.”
That’s a clear dig at Postmates, which frequently uses promotions and discounts to turn up engagement on the platform. Postmates also operates in some of the same markets as Favor in Texas.
With this new $22 million, Favor has now raised a total of $34 million.",2017-09-07,1537215,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/favor.png?w=738,startups/,"s3-ventures,favor","Favor, the on-demand service focused on Texas, picks up $22 million Series B",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/favor-the-on-demand-service-focused-on-texas-picks-up-22-million-series-b/
