Natasha Lomas,Collaborative Consumption,"Smart access startup Latch, which targets the enterprise market in the U.S., selling smart lock hardware and access control services to building owners and operators, has added a third product to its portfolio.
The ‘Latch C’ is notable as its first smart lock to be certified to work with HomeKit — Apple’s hardware certification program for makers of connected devices wanting to integrate with the iOS ecosystem.
Latch says it’s also the first “enterprise-certified smart lock” to work with HomeKit — enabling tenants living in apartments equipped with the device to connect it with other HomeKit devices inside their apartments to, for example, have their smart bulbs come on automatically when they return.
The Latch C also integrates into the iOS Home app and includes support for Siri — so a user could also ask the iOS voice assistant to open their door, say if they have their hands full of shopping. (Latch argues having an “intent signal”, such as voice or a tap, is more secure than ‘passive unlock’ approaches, just based on proximity detection.)
The smart lock includes Bluetooth, Wi-fi and NFC, as well as a wide-angle camera, a touchscreen and additional sensor tech to support its various capabilities — including unlocking doors with smartphones, keycards and doorcodes (supporting shared and temporary access, such as with delivery providers); and enabling the monitoring and managing of guest access (through camera and digital log). Also still present: a traditional key slot should a user prefer to continue packing metal.
The Latch C is designed to be installed on individual apartment doors that are equipped with a deadbolt, whereas Latch’s first product, the Latch M, works with mortise locks. This March the company also announced the Latch R: a reader-style electronic access product for building entrances, including lobby turnstiles and elevators.
With all three products co-founder Luke Schoenfelder says Latch is able to address a full spectrum of multi-unit and residential buildings across the U.S. — noting, for example, that “in some geographies, particularly in the American south and in some places in California, they use deadbolts in apartment buildings more than they use mortise locks”.
The Latch C could also be installed by building operators that lease standalone individual houses — with Schoenfelder pointing to the likes of Invitation Homes, which leases 50,000 homes across the U.S., as another type of potential customer for its sales pitch. (It’s worth noting Latch counts a number of funds from the real estate sector among its investors as strategic backers.)
“The mortise product [Latch M] is required by law in most major urban markets… and now, with the C, we’re able to work on any apartment door in the U.S. — so this really just completes the suite,” says Schoenfelder.
“For places that don’t require mortise locks they still have really stringent fire and building code requirements, and so the C is a deadbolt product that actually meets those requirements. We’re really the first smart lock deadbolt to meet those requirements.”
 
In an interesting development last month, Latch inked a deal with online retailer Jet to split the cost of installing its R smart locks on 1,000 urban residential buildings (with a total of 100,000 occupants) — revealing a strategy for growth that’s focused on selling smart access as an enabler of other, already in-demand digital services.
Latch presumably won Jet’s financial (and marketing) buy-in by pitching its smart access product as an enabler of Jet’s ecommerce — making it easier for the e-tailer to deliver to more customers (e.g. people in multi-apartment buildings without a receptionist or doorman to take parcels).
Though it’s also notable that Latch is part-funding some installations itself — to try to prime the pump for enterprise smart access in the residential buildings sector.
Its overarching thesis for targeting buildings owners/operators vs trying to convince consumers there’s value in the faff (and risk) of installing and maintaining a smart lock themselves, is that b2b offers the ability to accelerate uptake and buy-in of the technology and its benefits as deployments happen in large-scale chunks.
So while individual consumers may well remain sceptical about handling the cost of a smart lock themselves, building owners and operators can offer reassuringly certified smart access as a value-add service to their tenants, incentivized by the prospect of happier tenants who value the ability to receive Jet deliveries or Amazon parcels, or share temporary access to their home with their babysitter, and so on.
Albeit, if Latch’s product ends up making it easier for tenants to sublet apartments via home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb the startup may face something of a balancing act to manage competing interests. After all, putting a smart lock on a door is really an invitation to a whole range of new behaviors — and while landlords may be happy to indulge some of them, others may prove a sticking point.
“The next generation of consumers, many of them are not going to own their own homes. And are not going to own their own homes for quite a bit of time. And so the desire to bring the HomeKit experience to them is one of the really exciting things about this partnership,” says Schoenfelder. “We’re able to bring this HomeKit experience to products and spaces that otherwise you wouldn’t be able to have because if you don’t own your own place you’re not able to install a smart lock.”
He goes so far as to couch it as Latch giving Apple “a unique opportunity to bring HomeKit to an enterprise context”.
“Whereas, before, HomeKit has been really about a small group of users interacting with a product in a single family home, this allows us to have these really rich, many, many users to a single device [scenario]. So you can have one common area door that now 250 people are using, so you’re getting that exposure to this ecosystem and to the possibilities in a really magnified way.
“We’re really excited to align with [Apple’s] vision for — and to help further — what the vision of the modern building looks,” he adds.
The Latch C is priced at $299 per lock, plus the cost of a Latch subscription software plan service. Latch is taking pre-orders for the C now, with the first buildings due to receive the device this fall, according to Schoenfelder. (He won’t break out overall sales metrics across all the Latch locks as yet — claiming only that “they’re good”.)
The startup, which includes two ex-Apple employees among its three co-founders (Schoenfelder; and chief design officer Thomas Meyerhoffer), has raised a total of $26M since being founded in 2014 — most recently topping up its Series A with a further $10M this May.",2017-08-22,1528962,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/latch-c-lifestyle-photo.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"homekit,smart-access,smart-lock,latch",Latch adds HomeKit-approved smart lock to its enterprise suite,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/latch-adds-homekit-approved-smart-lock-to-its-enterprise-suite/
Frederic Lardinois,Enterprise,"Databricks, a big data analytics platform built by a team that grew out of the Apache Spark project, today announced that it has raised a $140 million Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from New Enterprise Associates and Battery Ventures. This brings Databricks’ total funding raised to date to $247 million, which includes a $60 million round the company announced only last December.
Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi tells me that he didn’t have to raise at this time but that the team saw a big opportunity for its service and wanted to be able to capitalize on it.
Indeed, the company says that it will use the funding to invest in its product, which aims to bring data science to more users inside virtually any businesses, and to accelerate its growth strategy. This includes a focus on some of the core industries like healthcare, financial services, government and media and entertainment that it has already found a foothold in over the last few years. The company also plans to grow its engineering and customer success teams.
“AI has enormous promise but also a 1% problem,” Ghodsi noted in today’s announcement.”Less than 10 companies in the world are achieving the full potential of AI and the rest are really struggling. Databricks’ mission is to simplify AI and bring it to the other 99% of enterprise organizations. This funding will enable us to expand our offering and bring it to many more markets, enabling more businesses to reap the benefits of Big Data and AI.”
Like so many other companies, Databricks is selling its services under the Artificial Intelligence umbrella, though for the most part, it uses advanced analytics and machine learning to help businesses make more accurate predictions. Current Databricks customers include the likes of Salesforce.com, Viacom, Shell, HP and Hotels.com.
The market for enterprise analytics is obviously pretty crowded, with a number of vendors ranging from Cloudera to IBM vying for a similar group of large enterprise customers. Databricks clearly hopes that this new investment will give it the resources to stay ahead of the curve and win new customers.",2017-08-22,1529390,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-160291638.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,databricks,Big data analytics platform Databricks raises $140M Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz,andreessen-horowitz,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/big-data-analytics-platform-databricks-raises-140m-series-d-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Skytap is probably one of the more interesting clouds right now. Unlike so many other startups, it’s not trying to offer enterprises specific cloud computing services on top of one of the big platforms like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Instead, the company actually runs its own cloud with the goal of helping enterprises that want to modernize their infrastructure bring their existing applications to its service.
As the company announced today, it has raised a $45 million Series E funding round led by Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing, with participation from existing investors. This brings Skytap’s total funding to date to $109 million according to Crunchbase.
Skytap is going up against all of the major cloud service providers, but Skytap CEO Thor Culverhouse argues that his competitors’ clouds were built for greenfield applications while Skytap was specifically built to serve Fortune 500 companies that want to slowly modernize their enterprise applications. The idea, of course, is for these enterprises to then stay on the Skytap cloud as they adopt new development paradigms like microservices and technologies like software containers.
Current customers include the likes of NBCUniversal, GE Healthcare, CA Technologies and OpenText.
To bring these companies to its cloud in the first place, though, Skytap focuses on allowing them to replicate their on-premises architectures on its platform. Those could be VMware setup on Linux, Solaris or Windows on x86 machines, but thanks to its close partnership with IBM, this also includes support for AIX on IBM Power Systems.
Culverhouse tells me that the company is now focussed on building out features like the Skytap Container Management service for companies that want to use containers to bring existing applications to its cloud and to develop new applications on it.
Skytap says that its average revenue per customer grew 60 percent year-over-year in Q2 2017 and that its cloud utilization rate has grown 10x in the last three years.",2017-08-22,1529406,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/skytap-office-3.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"enterprise,cloud,skytap",Skytap raises $45M for its enterprise cloud,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/skytap-raises-45m-for-its-enterprise-cloud/
Frederic Lardinois,Enterprise,"IBM today announced that it is working with a consortium that includes Dole, Golden State Foods, Kroger, McCormick and Company, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Unilever and Walmart to bring the benefit of blockchains to the food supply chain.
IBM, just like most of its competitors in the public cloud computing space, has been working on various blockchain projects in the last few months.
Given the complexity of the food supply chain from producer to consumer, blockchains could actually find a pretty interesting niche here because they would allow for more transparency and traceability (especially when things go wrong). The idea behind this project and the collaboration between these different companies is to figure out where exactly blockchains can benefit the food ecosystem.
“Blockchain technology enables a new era of end-to-end transparency in the global food system — equivalent to shining a light on food ecosystem participants that will further promote responsible actions and behaviors,” writes Frank Yiannas, Walmart’s VP for food safety, in today’s announcement. “It also allows all participants to share information rapidly and with confidence across a strong trusted network.”
Unsurprisingly, IBM’s Blockchain Platform will form the basis for much of this work. It supports the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer technologies for building blockchain-based applications.
It’s interesting to see how a number of the large players are now working to bring blockchains to the enterprise. Earlier this month, for example, Microsoft launched a new project to make blockchains ready for the enterprise, too, for example. Earlier this year, an IBM study also found that a third of enterprises are now looking into how this technology can benefit their business.
Correction: We previously included Costco as part of this consortium. The company was mentioned in an early press release but not in the final version. We regret this error and have commenced self-flagellation.",2017-08-22,1529364,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ibmblockchain_02_crop.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"blockchains,costco,walmart,ibm","IBM, Kroger, Walmart and others team up to improve food safety with blockchains",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/ibm-costco-walmart-and-others-team-up-to-improve-food-safety-with-blockchains/
Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"Redis Labs, a database company that specializes in in-memory databases, said today it has raised $44 million in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs.
Redis Labs is like other typical open source-based database companies, where it offers the technology for free while charging for an enterprise tier. It’s a bet that while anyone can build something on the technology, the company will have the core competency to help companies manage their databases best.
The company offers a database option that’s designed to be faster thanks to operating a database on the server’s memory. By doing that, in theory, companies should be able to handle operations (like those executed in NoSQL). There seems to have been a bit of an uptake in database startups, given the new financing for Redis Labs as well as MongoDB confidentially filing for an IPO per our previous reporting.
Anyone can host their open-source version, but the enterprise tier offers companies the option of handling their databases in the cloud. That obviously offers benefits for companies that are looking to use the technology but have to devote resources elsewhere.
It’s a model that’s spawned a few successful companies, like Docker and Cloudera. The latter went public, initially popping around 20 percent, though it’s had a middling time in the past month or so. The former is said to be raising financing at a $1.3 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.

John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"Despite countless attempts and millions in venture capital, the calendar, one of the most ubiquitous work tools, has remained largely unchanged for as long as I can remember. Rather than overwrite the calendar in an effort to make it obsolete, Ahryun Moon, Jasper Sone and Peter Lee, co-founders of GoodTime, are putting the calendar front and center — embracing it as a means of understanding people.
With $2 million from a seed financing round led by Big Basin Capital and Walden Venture Capital, GoodTime’s big vision is manifesting itself initially as an HR tool. With a dash of natural language processing, GoodTime is helping recruiting teams match job applicants with the right interviewers.
In competitive hiring environments, appropriately pairing a top candidate with an interviewer sharing prior work experience or university affiliation might be the difference maker in convincing that person to take the job. Of course, this idea isn’t new; recruiters typically spend significant portions of their time manually checking calendars to coordinate schedules and matchmake.
“I met a recruiter from CoinBase who spends half her day scheduling interviews,” Moon told me.
GoodTime integrates with applicant tracking systems to obtain information on candidates. This data is then paired with basic details about current employees. This information isn’t particularly hard to extract, but it does come from myriad unexpected places — spreadsheets, assorted documents and the like.
“Often in AI, people think about machines replicating what a human would be doing,” Sone said of others in the ecosystem taking a more bot-centric approach. “We found out that even though that’s a cool application, candidates don’t want to spend more time going back and forth.”
All of this is helpful and it saves recruiters loads of time, but it’s only a small part of GoodTime’s vision. The other half of the problem is digging through calendars to differentiate critical meetings from junk reminders and other unimportant calendar items.
We all are guilty of filling in our calendars in such a way that they only make sense to us. Email reminders get placed next to eclipse reminders and we block off time for optional all-hands conference calls even when we have no intention of attending.
Unfortunately, this makes it really hard for a machine to automatically schedule and optimize interviews. So the team is working on adding functionality that will interpret the importance of calendar items. With a human in the loop, GoodTime would be able to bump an important interview above a birthday reminder by classifying events into categories.
GoodTime has managed to rack up a number of early users. Airbnb is paying to use the platform to coordinate its engineering interviews. The company also has found product market fit working with Stripe, Thumbtack and others. Some of these use cases have involved helping to diversify interview panels as well.
And beyond just HR, the team sees potential in the calendar as a means of helping people optimize their days. The startup is looking to make some key hires in sales and engineering, particularly around machine learning.",2017-08-21,1529058,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-656282183.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"moon,business,calendar,economy",GoodTime nabs $2M to match job applicants with interviewers to save time and build rapport,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/goodtime-nabs-2m-to-match-job-applicants-with-interviewers-to-save-time-and-build-rapport/
Matthew Lynley,Enterprise,"You’ve probably had the experience of going to a website and seeing a lot of content that’s not really relevant. For the most part, a lot of this is organized in a way that’s either pre-defined or based on a limited number of signals that aims to sort of personalize the experience for a normal user.
But as time goes on and the competition for eyeballs continues to heat up, that light level of personalization probably won’t be enough. Instead, users can go to Facebook or Amazon, which have an enormous amount of data on its users, to get a much more personalized experience. Every other site that wants the attention of users needs to have a better-curated experience, and that’s what LiftIgniter is hoping to help those sites achieve. The company is raising $6.4 million in a round led by Storm Ventures. LiftIgniter has raised $8.25 million to date and was a finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016.
The goal is that the software will help customize the content on any given page for a specific user, which, hopefully, makes their experience more enjoyable. Those users may then end up either coming back over and over or eventually converting to customers and buying products. It’s all designed to create a more engaging experience, which in the end will help drive additional business to these sites through either more customer conversions or simply more unique visits and page views. LiftIgniter services more than 5 billion page views a month, co-founder Adam Spector said.
“Our view is that there should be a personalization API, just like there’s an API for text messages with Twilio or payments with Stripe,” Spector said. “Every digital property should have personalization built in. Media, e-commerce, enterprise, business-to-business SaaS, it doesn’t matter. If you create an experience for users, you should want to give them something they want. The only way to do that at scale is with machine learning.”
Emphasized by co-founder Indraneel Mukherjee and Spector, “machine learning” part is important because the signals that users give to various websites are going to constantly be changing. As more and more users feed more and more data to the internet, having a truly engaging and personalized experience is table stakes to keep someone’s attention. A lot of companies will claim to be AI companies, but Spector says LiftIgniter has its own flavor that looks at a ton of signals that help define a profile of a user. Each signal is dependent on the last, and it’s the sum of those signals — all closely intertwined — that determines the user’s experience.
“Our customers’ websites are living and breathing things, and the connections between every piece of content is changing,” Spector said. “The articles you write today could be super relevant to an article that’s five years old. The relevance may change over time. The world is constantly in flux, the idea of having a hard-coded, static list of connections doesn’t make sense.”
A product like LiftIgniter certainly makes sense: you probably won’t be able to manually update your site fast enough to suit your specific visitors’ needs — especially for each individual user. But the sum of all those individual users is what will drive business, whether that’s through advertising views or purchases. Instead of manually curating a site or a shopping experience and hoping for the best, LiftIgniter tries to convince companies that it can do it at a technical level and drive results immediately.
And that’s one of the core elements of the company. LiftIgniter aims to ensure that the companies are able to get some meaningful metrics of success within 30 days of deploying it. That’s key for many companies, which are looking for some kind of return on any services they employ but may not necessarily get them right away. If you’re going to A/B test and try to personalize your site in order to get users to engage with it more, you’ll want to figure out if the service is actually going to be successful. That means that the companies can, early on, define various objectives and LiftIgniter will try to determine whether it’s able to hit those kinds of targets.
It’s going to be a crowded space — with plenty of competition from companies like Google — as companies race to build these kinds of products for companies. They’re going to become mission-critical tools for the rest of the world going forward as Facebook and other services train users to become completely accustomed to very personalized content. LiftIgniter hopes that creating a sort of blanket tool that any site can employ, as well as very quickly demonstrating some success, will give it a competitive edge to survive.
“We’re literally diverging from ourselves in every moment,” Spector said. “Humans adjust to a changing environment well. Our goals are going to be able to adjust for that and give users what they want. There’s no way I could consume every article. I should find the article I care about with a minimal amount of effort. Without that, they bounce back to Google, or Facebook, and then we outsource their discovery to Facebook and Google.”",2017-08-17,1528216,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/liftigniter2.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"personalization,liftigniter",LiftIgniter raises $6.4M to bring website personalization to the rest of the internet,"google,facebook",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/liftigniter-raises-6-4m-to-bring-website-personalization-to-the-rest-of-the-internet/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"CoreOS today announced the general availability of Microsoft Azure support for its Kubernetes-based Tectonic container management platform. It previously only fully supported container deployments on bare metal servers and AWS. Beta support for Azure launched in March and with this new release, Tectonic now offers hybrid support for multi-cloud deployments across its three supported platforms.
“This major release of Tectonic and stable release on Microsoft Azure is an important step to deliver on the promise of multi-cloud, making infrastructure and operations more efficient and scalable,” said Rob Szumski, product manager, Tectonic, at CoreOS. “Tectonic on Azure saves you time and money by building your Kubernetes infrastructure correctly from the beginning and speeding up deployment cycles. With the ability to do hybrid cloud deployments, infrastructure leaders have the freedom and flexibility of a platform that does not lock users into cloud compute and cloud services.”

Other updates to Tectonic include full support for Kubernetes 1.7, the latest release of the Google-incubated container orchestration service. Upgrading to the latest release is a one-click process and the company promises that users won’t incur any downtime during the update procedure. That’s a major advantage compared to the early days of Kubernetes, when upgrading was a hassle, no matter which platform you chose.
Also new are network policy support (in alpha) to allow users to exercise more control over inbound traffic and pre-configured alerts for when things go awry in a container deployment.",2017-08-17,1527885,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/image002-2.png?w=738,enterprise/,"containers,tectonic,coreos",CoreOS’s Tectonic container platform gets full support for Microsoft Azure,microsoft-azure,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/coreoss-tectonic-container-platform-gets-full-support-for-microsoft-azure/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Microsoft announced a new product in its Azure line-up in preview today that will make it easier for developers to build event-based applications.
The Azure Event Grid makes events (like uploading a picture or video, clicking a button, updating a database, etc.) first-class Azure objects. Event Grid complements Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft’s existing serverless offerings, and gives developers access to a fully managed event routing service. This new service gives them the flexibility to ingest and react to virtually any event — whether that’s happening inside Azure or on a third-party service or in an existing application.
Developers can use Event Grid to route events to specific endpoints (or even multiple endpoints) and filter them as necessary.
“Serverless” has always been a misnomer, given that even the most serverless of serverless applications still needs to run on servers. Still, the basic idea behind serverless platforms is that you can use this model to build event-driven applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.Indeed, Microsoft director of Azure Compute Corey Sanders told me that Event Grid actually sits on top of Service Fabric, Microsoft’s platform for building microservices. As a developer, though, you don’t need to worry about managing these services — the platform will handle that for you.
Event Grid takes the ideas of Azure Functions and Logic Apps a bit further, though, thanks to its built-in ability to take inputs from any application with the help of webhook endpoints. “The goal here is to offer a first-class event object that customers can manage and manipulate,” Sanders told me. Out of the box, Event Grid also supports Azure Blog Storage, Resource Manager, Application Topics, Event Hubs, Azure Functions, Azure Automation and Logic Apps, with support for other Azure-based services, including the new CosmosDB database service and IoT Hub, coming later this year. Given that IoT applications are a logical fit for this service, it’s actually a bit of a surprise that support for IoT Hub isn’t part of this initial release.
Beyond standard serverless applications and integrations (something that Logic Apps is already pretty good at), developers can also use Event Grid to automate some of the operations workflows to react to newly spun up virtual machines or databases, for example.
Pricing for Event Grid is based on the number of operations you process. The first 100,00 operations are free; after that, you pay $0.60 per million operations (though during the preview, that price is currently $0.30 per million operations). Operations are defined as any ingress, advanced match, delivery attempt or management call.

Darrell Etherington,Media,"Snapchat could start offering original scripted content very soon, according to its content lead Nick Bell (via Variety). Snapchat has already done a lot with creators to build shows, including tie-ins for big broadcast hits like The Voice and The Bachelor, and it’s also working with A&E on reality TV via Second Chance, a dating show featuring exes.
This isn’t Snapchat’s first foray into scripted content, either. The social app ran a series called Literally Can’t Even back in 2015, which received generally awful critical reviews, inspiring headlines including “We ‘Literally Can’t Even’ with Snapchat’s new original series” and “Snapchat’s First Original Series is Here and It’s Awful.”
This new effort sounds like a rethinking of its approach, featuring “some” content by the end of 2018 according to Variety. Original scripted programming carries with it significant cost, which could be one reason why it has avoided it to date, but Snapchat seems fairly bullish on the idea of becoming a broad-ranging video consumption platform for younger audiences.
Snapchat isn’t the only tech company looking at producing originals to drive interest among video viewers, however; Apple is reportedly investing $1 billion in original content efforts next year, and Facebook’s Watch tab debuted earlier this month.",2017-08-23,1530377,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/snapchat-tv.jpg?w=738,social/,,Snapchat likely to begin scripted original content push by end of year,snapchat,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/snapchat-likely-to-begin-scripted-original-content-push-by-end-of-year/
Ingrid Lunden,Social,"Video is the name of the game in social networking: sites like Facebook and Twitter have been doubling down on the medium in recent years to drive more traffic and engagement from users, and also as a platform to snare more premium advertising away from traditional television broadcasters; Snapchat put video at the core of its service from Day One.
Now Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is hoping to muscle in on the party with its own video strategy. Today the social networking site for the working world is launching a new feature to let any user upload a video to the site, via LinkedIn’s iOS or Android mobile app.
The idea will be to let users create videos that highlight their professional work: projects that have been finished or are in progress; product demonstrations; and other work-related videos that highlight what you do. It looks and feels very much like a video launch for the non-Snapchat set. For those who might not know where to start but think it might be a good idea to upload some video, LinkedIn has taken the very un-Snapchatty route of providing some direction and pointers.
The feature getting announced today isn’t entirely new: the company started a limited release of it earlier this year. Early evidence seems to point to video doing just what LinkedIn hoped it would: so far, videos from the limited release are already getting shared 20 times more than any other content. Before that, there were other dabbles in video: last year, LinkedIn launched a Quora-style Q&A service with influencers on the site that marked its first foray into moving pictures.
Launching user-generated video is a long time coming, but for the 500 million of us who use LinkedIn, being late isn’t too much of a surprise.
LinkedIn hasn’t been known as the fastest moving of social networks over the years. Run a short Google search on the words “LinkedIn” and “finally” on TC or across the wider web and you can see the story of how it was late(r) to the party on mobile (Android, iPad and later giving more parity to the mobile and web experiences), on other advanced features for users to communicate and share news, on targeting the developing world and more.
“We have been focused on expanding the ways members can create and share professional content,” a spokesperson told me in response to my questions about why it has taken so long to launch a video product. “As we did with the ability to publish, we wanted to take a thoughtful approach to introduce video creation to the LinkedIn platform in a way that it adds to the consumption experience, and fits seamlessly with how our members post, share and discover.”
But now that the ball has gotten rolling, what is interesting to me is to consider how LinkedIn might evolve the product, and just how it could fit into what it has built and wants to develop in the future.

Key to that is launching live video.
Earlier this year, LinkedIn quietly hired a product manager from Facebook Live called Peter Roybal, who is heading up the video service. Roybal reports to Pete Davies, who joined LinkedIn when the company last year quietly acquired his startup Run Hop, and now oversees all of LinkedIn’s content and publishing. The fact that Roybal had been involved with FB Live — the mammoth social network’s own live broadcasting platform — is a strong sign of where LinkedIn hopes to take its own video offering.
Live video is an obvious and natural complement to what LinkedIn has already been developing on its platform in areas like education, company profile pages, recruitment and professional networking.
In education, after buying Lynda.com for $1.5 billion, LinkedIn has created a site called LinkedIn Learning, which offers online courses both for individuals and companies training their employees. It’s also been piloting a mentoring program this summer.
All of these are areas where you could imagine live video components, either providing a one-to-many broadcasting feature with text-based interactions from viewers or one-to-one video chats.
One-to-one video chats are also a no-brainer when you consider LinkedIn’s recruitment business, which has for years made up the majority of its revenues: video can be used both to help advertise businesses and open positions, as well as a tool for interviewing candidates.
(Sidenote: one area that we haven’t seen any activity at all is any link up between LinkedIn and Skype, another Microsoft business. But we’ve heard that Skype is also building a platform for interviews. Microsoft declined to comment when we asked about it, but it’s already a popular use for Skype and so it would make sense to formalize that.)
“Live video and live video chat is an interesting possibility down the road because it helps people add a whole different dimension,” the LinkedIn spokesperson said.
Other areas where LinkedIn is very likely to bring video in the near future is advertising and videos from companies on the service.
Company videos are “coming soon,” the spokesperson tells me, and a separate source notes that these videos will be hosted both on company pages as well as in other places: another feature that LinkedIn has been quietly developing has been event-style pages that let you search for specific subjects by hashtags in order to browse videos and other content related to them (here is one for #TED2017). These pages will give users one more ways to discover that video content.
Much of this, longer term, is likely to help feed into one of the biggest reasons for getting deeper into video in the first place: advertising.
As Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, Yahoo/AOL/Oath and others have found, video is where the money is for digital advertising today, so bringing more content around the medium overall would help LinkedIn move into video advertising more naturally, as well.
“We don’t currently serve video ads at this time. We’re focused on building a great experience and learning from our members. But this is a natural progression and something we are evaluating for the future,” the company tells me. “There aren’t plans today, but there are a lot of interesting features that we’re going to look at.”
A moving target for sure, but one that LinkedIn (and Microsoft) are now very focused on hitting.",2017-08-22,1529721,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/linkedin-native-video-1.png?w=738,social/,video,LinkedIn opens video uploads to all as part of a bigger video push,linkedin,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/linkedin-video/
Natasha Lomas,Social,"Facebook is losing appeal among teens and young adults which is contributing to generally slowing growth for the platform, according to the latest projections from research firm eMarketer.
At the same time alternative social apps Snapchat and (Facebook-owned) Instagram are seeing rising and double-digit growth in the same youth demographic — suggesting younger users are favoring newer and more visual communications platforms.
“Both platforms have found success with this demographic since they are more aligned with how they communicate — using visual content,” noted eMarketer forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco in a statement.
It’s the second consecutive year of expected usage declines for Facebook among this advertiser-coveted group, according to the researcher.
eMarketer suggests some tweens are even skipping adopting Facebook entirely (it calls them “Facebook nevers”) and going straight to the rival platforms, even as remaining tweens and teens appear less engaged on Facebook — logging in less frequently and spending less time on the platform.
While having slipping relevance among a coveted ad demographic is obviously not good news for a social behemoth whose business is dependent on ad revenue, Facebook does have the consolation of also owning one of the two main youth-friendly alternative platforms: Instagram. (Aka, ‘if you can’t be it, buy it’.)
Still, eMarketer is also projecting that the acquisition that got away from Zuck, Snapchat, will overtake Instagram and Facebook in the total teen (12 to 17) & young adult (18 to 24) ages for the first time in 2017 — boosting its share of US social network users to 40.8 per cent, and projected to push close to a majority by 2021. (Though Instagram is also forecast to maintain its greater reach through this timeframe.)
Back in 2013, when reports of Facebook’s spurned acquisition attempts of Snapchat surfaced, it followed fast on the heels of the company reporting a first-time decline in young teens using its service daily.
Nearly four years later Facebook’s problem with keeping teens happy has only got bigger — but the company’s success at using Instagram to successfully clone Snapchat’s features has helped mitigate the issue. (Even if it means Facebook’s corporate motto should really now read: ‘Move fast and clone things’.)
eMarketer couched U.S. Facebook usage in the 12 and 17 age-group as dropping the most “precipitously” — noting that while 81.9% of social network users in that age range are projected to use Facebook this year, the figure will slide to 76.2% by 2021.
Other highlights from eMarketer’s forecast:


eMarketer’s methodology counts a monthly user as someone who is accessing their account at least once per month, consistently, each month throughout the calendar year. It says it bases its forecasts on analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government agencies, media firms and public companies, along with interviews with senior execs at publishers, ad buyers and agencies.

Josh Constine,Apps,"Should your parents be able to read your Facebook messages if you die? Facebook explained why it won’t let them in a post in its Hard Questions series today about social networking after death.
Facebook admits it doesn’t have all the answers, but it has come up with some decent solutions to some issues with what it calls Memorialized Profiles and a “Legacy Contact.” When you pass away, once Facebook is informed, the word “Remembering” appears above your name on your profile and no one else can sign in to your account.

The Legacy Contact is a friend you select in your Manage Account Settings while you’re still alive, though they’re not informed until your profile is memorialized. They can pin a post atop your profile, change your profile pic, respond to friend requests or have your account removed. But Facebook explains they can’t log into your account, change or delete old posts, remove friends or read your messages.
Similarly, Facebook won’t allow parents or anyone else to read your messages after you die. That’s because “In a private conversation between two people, we assume that both people intended the messages to remain private,” writes Monika Bickert, Facebook’s Director of Global Policy Management. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and Stored Communications Act may also prohibit it from sharing private communications even with parental consent.
Facebook also tries to minimize the emotional impact of losing a loved one by no longer sending birthday reminders about writing on their wall. But there are still plenty of opportunities for hurt feelings. Facebook’s On This Day feature and others can surface old content from when that person was still alive, creating an unexpected experience of having to think about their death.

The company has built features to enhance empathy with its users, allowing them to avoid unnecessarily seeing their exes on the app after a break-up. But it’s tough to know what will be a sweet nostalgic reminder and what will be a heart-wrenching spiral into the past.
What’s important is that Facebook is at least thinking and talking about these issues. Now at 2 billion users, Facebook has become a ubiquitous utility that impacts every phase of our lives. “There’s a deep sense of responsibility in every part of the company,” says Facebook CPO Chris Cox. “We’re getting to the scale where we have to get much better about understanding how the product has been used.”",2017-08-18,1528526,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/what-happens-on-facebook-when-you-die.png?w=738,social/,,How Facebook prioritizes privacy when you die,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/facebook-after-death/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"Instagram inception, here we come. If somebody sends you a photo or video in a private conversation on Instagram, the app will now let you play around with the original photo so that you can reply in a creative way and keep the context of the conversation.
If you receive a photo or video, there’s now a reply button in the conversation thread. If you tap on this button, the original photo is instantly turned into a sticker in the top right corner. You can leave it there and reply with some context
But you can also move it around, tilt it and draw around it. If you’re replying to a video, it looks like Instagram only keeps a screenshot of the first frame.
If you tap on it, the original photo fills the top half of the screen. You can then take a selfie for the bottom half of the photo. It reminds me of Frontback, a photo-sharing app that lets you take a photo of what you have in front of you, and a photo of your reaction with a selfie. Instagram works the same way as it features both the context and your reaction.
The comparison stops there as you can still apply filters, draw on your photo, add stickers, write text and use all those creative tools together. Your reaction doesn’t have to be a photo either. You can record a video, a boomerang, use a selfie filter and more.
More importantly, this new reply mode isn’t limited to direct messages. If you’re watching a story, you can either send a text reply by tapping on the text field at the bottom of the screen, or you can send a photo/video reply by tapping on the camera icon at the bottom left of the screen. And that makes a lot of sense as you want to know the context when somebody is replying to part of your story.

Devin Coldewey,Social,"(Updated with statements from Google and Gab.)
Gab, the conservative social network that has acted as a haven for people banned from the usual platforms, has been removed from the Google Play Store for violating the company’s hate speech policy, the company announced on Twitter. Apple rejected it from the App Store in June for similar reasons.
	
It’s not clear what specifically Gab did that warranted its being kicked off the store, but presumably it would have to be at the level of the app itself, not just someone idly venting hatred on the service. After all, there’s plenty of hate speech on Twitter and YouTube, but those apps are still available despite a crackdown this week following the events in Charlottesville. It seems it was a question of volume and repeated complaints about the content Gab or its community failed to remove.
In a statement, Google didn’t get too specific, but indicated it was a lack of moderation:
This doesn’t mean Google has blocked the app entirely — it can’t do that. You just can’t download it from the Play Store any more. It should still function fine and users will be able to sideload it if they like, and Gab’s Twitter account indicates they’re working on making that easy.
Gab is aimed at people interested in “Western values, individual liberty, and the free exchange of ideas” looking to avoid the “special interests pushing a very specific agenda” in tech. If that dog whistle isn’t loud enough, the investment page lists readers of Breitbart, Drudge and Infowars as the target demographic.
It was founded by Andrew Torba, who in December was removed from Y Combinator’s alumni network (which he had joined after taking part in the program) for his behavior among the other founders there.

Josh Constine,Apps,"Ever gotten tricked into clicking a fake play button on Facebook that opens a link instead of starting a video? I did, repeatedly, and wrote a story in 2014 titled “Yo Facebook, Ban Links With Fake Video Play Buttons”.
Now Facebook is doing just that. Today it started downranking the News Feed presence of links that display a fake play button in the preview image, as well as videos that are actually just a static image uploaded as a video file. Publishers who use these scammy tactics will see a major decrease in the distribution of these stories. Facebook won’t completely delete these posts, though, unless they violate its other policies.
Here are two examples of fake play buttons that spammers used to steal your clicks:

Facebook has prohibited the use of fake play buttons in advertisements under its policy against depicting non-existent functionality for a few years, News Feed Product Manager Greg Marra tells me. But the scourage has remained in the News Feed.
“We’ve heard from people who are frustrated by fake play buttons” Marra says, hence today’s update. “Spammers are using these tactics to trick people into clicking links to low quality web pages.Facebook tells me its now training its machine vision artificial intelligence to classify and detect fake play buttons in preview images.
“While the prevalence is statistically low, the frustration expressed by people who use Facebook who encounter these deceptive practices is high” a spokesperson tells me.
Facebook says that if publishers want to denote there’s a video behind a link, they should indicate that through Open Graph meta tags. They could also use words like “Watch” or “Video” in the headline or description.
 
Facebook has had a similar problem with publishers looping pre-recorded videos and calling them live, or just putting up a computer graphic countdown and calling it Live. TechCrunch called on Facebook to ban these shenanigans back in January, and it cracked down on them in May.
There’s also been the issue of publishers putting fake Instant Articles “Lightning Bolt” icons on the preview images of links to non-Instant Articles on the standard web. That’s because people are more likely to click Instant Articles since they load faster.
Meanwhile, Facebook’s emphasis on video in News Feed has inspired the new menace of publishers uploading a static image as a video to get more eyeballs. These static image videos will be downranked too. Facebook is using a “motion scoring” system that detects movement inside a video to classify and demote these clips.

Today’s changes come as part of a massive, multi-pronged atack on clickbait. Facebook now downranks headlines that are misleading or withhold information in many languages, shows fewer links overshared by spammers, works with outside fact checkers to demote false news, promotes iand now shows Related Articles with different angles to make people suspicious of exaggerated clickbait.
With each of these updates, Facebook chips away at the clickbait problem, leaving more room in the News Feed for legitimate content. Getting burned by trying to watch a video which is just endless minutes of the same image erodes trust in the News Feed, making people less likely to watch videos in the future.
By excising these annoying experiences, users may be willing to browse longer, view more videos from friends and publishers, and watch lucrative video ads that fund Facebook’s soaring profits.",2017-08-17,1528083,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-fake-video-play-buttons.png?w=738,social/,,Facebook downranks video clickbait and fake play buttons,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/facebook-fake-play-buttons/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"In June, Microsoft introduced a completely revamped version of its Skype app, designed with a heavier focus on media-sharing, and other social expression tools, like emoji, reactions, and even a Snapchat-like stories feature. Now that new experience is rolling out to desktop users, but in a more limited fashion, Microsoft announced this morning.
The new desktop app introduces an updated user interface that’s meant to give Skype a more youthful feel. Group chats are multi-colored. Bright, squiggly lines are used to indicate when contacts are typing or to separate out unread messages, among other things. Chats are given more prominent billing. Emojis can be used to ‘react’ to what others are saying while in video calls or in text conversations.
These changes, when Skype’s update arrived on mobile, were too radical for many users. The app suffered from poor reviews on the App Store and Google Play, with many accusing the company of having Snapchat envy.

But there are some additions that will be useful in the new Skype desktop, despite all this social app envy. For example, a new media gallery can be viewed on the right side of a group chat, which makes it easier to locate shared files, like documents, spreadsheets, photos or other media, that had been posted into the group.
However, this gallery is a bit too jazzy…when it’s empty, it has a busy, squiggly line-filled background that seems entirely unnecessary.
Group calling has gotten a makeover too, with support for real-time screen and photo sharing, and of course, emoji reactions that pop up as a temporary overlay on the screen. (Which you probably should not use during work calls, okay?)
Skype is also adding support for @mentions – something that’s become a convention in social and communication apps, whether work-related or not. Most major apps today – like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Slack, etc. – support this functionality, so it makes sense to bring it to Skype, too.
When you first launch the new app, you can pick between a light or dark theme – the latter which has become a popular choice for social apps as of late, with dark themes appearing on services like YouTube and Twitter.
When you want to start a chat, group or call, you now do so from a plus button on the top left. Here, you can also find Skype’s list of available bots, like those for travel, work, entertainment and gaming.
One more prominent feature that was a key part of Skype’s mobile makeover, however, is missing: Highlights.
This was Skype’s Snapchat-like take on Stories. The idea is that users would snap a photo or video, decorate it with text and stickers, then share it by posting to Highlights, where your followers can view it at any time.
But don’t get too excited if you were hoping to avoid the Stories takeover of social media. Microsoft tells us Highlights is still in the works for the desktop app. It and other new features, will arrive in future previews, a spokesperson says.

The desktop app is rolling out today as a Skype Preview for Mac users and those with non-Windows 10 PCs.

Natasha Lomas,Europe,"Rebooting the venerable Nokia smartphone brand has not been a rush job for HMD Global, the Foxconn-backed company set up for the purpose of licensing the Nokia name to try to revive the brand’s fortunes on smartphones.
But after starting with basic and mid-tier smartphones, it’s finally outted a flagship Android handset, called the Nokia 8, which it will be hoping can put some dents in Samsung’s high end. And/or pull consumers away from Huawei’s flagships handsets — or indeed the swathe of Chinese OEMs surging up the smartphone market share ranks.
With the Nokia 8, HMD is putting its flagship focus on content creators wanting to livestream video for their social feeds.
Competition in the Android OEM space has been fierce for years and there’s no signs of any slack appearing so HDM faces a steep challenge to make any kind of dent here. But at least it now has an iron in the fire. As analyst CCS Insight notes, the handset will be “hugely important in getting Nokia-branded smartphones back on the mobile phone map”.
Specs wise, the Nokia 8 runs the latest version of Android (Nougat 7.1.1) — which HMD is touting as a “pure Android experience”, akin to Google’s Pixel handsets. (There’s a not-so-gentle irony there, given Nokia’s history in smartphones. But clearly HMD is going full in on Android.)
On the hardware front, there’s a top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, plus 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory (expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot). While the 5.3 inch Quad HD resolution display puts it on the verge of phablet territory — and squarely within the current smartphone screen size sweet spot.
Also on board: dual rear cameras, both 13MP (one color, one B&W), and a 13MP front facing lens — all with f/2.0; using Zeiss optics; and with support for 4K video.
The flagship camera feature — and really phone feature too — is the ability to livestream video from both front and back cameras simultaneously.
HMD is trying to coin a hashtaggable word to describe this: “bothie” (as opposed to a selfie)…
This split screen camera feature can also be used for photos — so they’ve basically reinvented Frontback. Well done.
“Content creators can natively broadcast their unique #Bothie stories to social media through the Dual-Sight functionality located within the camera app. Fans can also enjoy unlimited photo [<16MB in size] and video uploads to Google Photos,” HMD writes.
This could prove a sticky feature for social media lovers — perhaps especially the dual video option, which lets people share twin perspective video direct to Facebook and YouTube via the camera app.
Or it could prove a passing fad, like Frontback. Time will tell. CCS Insight describes it as an “interesting approach” but also cautions on whether consumers will take to it.
Commenting on the feature in a statement, HMD’s Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer, said: “We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It’s these people who have inspired us.”
Elsewhere on the device, there’s a spatial surround sound recording tech that uses three microphones and is apparently drawing on Nokia’s Ozo 360 camera division, plus USB type C charging port; a 3.5mm headphone jack; and a non-removable 3090 mAh battery.
The handset, which is clad in an aluminium unibody casing and has a fingerprint reader on the front for device unlocking and authentication, is described as splashproof rather than waterproof.
Global RRP for the Nokia 8 is €599, with a rollout due to start in September. The handset comes in a choice of four colors: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.

John Biggs,Social,"The past week has been a tough one for lovers of freedom. Slippery slopes have been slid down and a side of the human mind that once remained in shadow has reared its head. Charlottesville is just the first step down a dark road.
In real life, on the public square, our support of freedom of speech and public assembly – a freedom that has long helped hater and lover alike – is in question. Do we open our squares to men who will fight equality? Do we unlock our school grounds so that fear can reign? Do we simply close our windows on loudspeakers calling out for genocide or do we act? I don’t have an answer, but sunlight has always been the best antiseptic and seeing most of these groups on a bare parade ground lays bare their insignificance.
But what do you about the Internet where everything is shadow hiding inside corporate iron? The Internet is a utility, to a degree, but not one whose sanctity is guaranteed to us by some holy writ. We send bits over corporate networks onto servers housed in corporate basements. We shout into corporate megaphones and write screeds – like this one – into corporate editor windows.
On that skein of wires there is no sunlight. We, the creators of that world, must decide. Do we let hate live alongside love? What is conversation when everyone yells? What is fair when everyone has the loudest voice?
I was once a free-love kind of Internet zealot. I still agree that DRM is wrong, that media wants to be free and that good media will be paid for by someone. I still agree that sex is far less egregious than violence and that visions of both help define the lines of our personalities and ensure we do not wander too far into some puritan desert. I was angry, for example, when Pinterest pulled sexual content but know I know things have changed. Pinterest runs is own servers. It is responsible for the contents. It deserves final say.
And that’s where we are now. If you hate, says Wired in a recent profile of Instagram’s Kevin Systrom, you will be shut down.
“Insta­gram is supposed to be a place for self-expression and joy,” wrote Nicholas Thompson in the profile. “Who wants to express themselves, though, if they’re going to be mocked, harassed, and shamed in the comments below a post? Instagram is a bit like Disneyland—if every now and then the seven dwarfs hollered at Snow White for looking fat.”
Or who wants to star in a Ghostbusters reboot and be called racial slurs? And who wants to live in a world where /r/aww lives next to /r/poli?
We, the curators of the Internet, have to decide. Some of us already have. We see Cloudflare and GoDaddy pulling their services from white power site Daily Stormer. Cloudflare’s CEO Matthew Prince agonized over the decision. He, like most Internet users, expects the web to be free as in freedom.
“Our team has been thorough and have had thoughtful discussions for years about what the right policy was on censoring. Like a lot of people, we’ve felt angry at these hateful people for a long time but we have followed the law and remained content neutral as a network. We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare,” he wrote. “You, like me, may believe that the Daily Stormer’s site is vile. You may believe it should be restricted. You may think the authors of the site should be prosecuted. Reasonable people can and do believe all those things. But having the mechanism of content control be vigilante hackers launching DDoS attacks subverts any rational concept of justice.”
In the end this is where we must go. It’s folks like Rabbi Abe Cooper as well as Valley CEOs who will help us find a way forward. Freedom of speech in the public square is one right we all have. But there is no free speech in the walled garden if the gardener doesn’t will it.

Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Pinterest is adding a new feature today that allows users to pinch a photo to zoom in and out on various Pins, matching a feature that’s available on a lot of other services, like Instagram.
Pinterest is trying to be a central hub of high-quality photos and videos centered around ideas and products, but this still more or less exemplifies that the ability to manipulate photos within the app has started to become table stakes for sites like Pinterest. It also has to refine its visual search product as more and more companies offer similar products, like Google (ironically also called Lens, the same name as Pinterest’s camera search product). As the company becomes increasingly focused on mobile and discovery centered around photos, users will start expecting the kinds of behaviors that exist on other services (like Instagram) to exist on Pinterest.
One of Pinterest’s core directives is to push people closer and closer toward a moment of inspiration where they act on some kind of idea they discover on Pinterest. That can include buying a product, downloading an app or even changing things in their closet based on something they see on Pinterest. If Pinterest is able to do that, it can go to advertisers and explain that it has a different kind of user behavior that they won’t find on Facebook or Snap — and get them to start spending a lot of money on Pinterest.
Zooming in on a photo to get a better look at something seems like a good feature for digging through cluttered photos in order to identify a product. Pinterest is giving users a way to take photos in order to search for products, but those kinds of amateur photos might not have the right products in focus. That might be especially true for rooms in homes and could hold true even for professional photos.

That might also help Pinterest fend off apps picking off certain use cases that the company has traditionally owned. Houzz, for example, is trying to become a go-to place for interior design and products you would buy for your home. That’s catapulted Houzz into a startup with a $4 billion valuation.
Pinterest is also making a small tweak to make the option to search visually on a Pin easier to find. All these kinds of tweaks may seem somewhat small. But the sum of these incremental changes may help Pinterest continue to show advertisers that it’s a company that deserves a big chunk of their ad budgets typically reserved for Google and Facebook. Pinterest recently raised capital at a $12.3 billion valuation, and if it’s going to justify that valuation it has to turn into a critical spend for marketers.",2017-08-16,1527585,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pinterest-zoom-gif.gif?w=738,social/,"pinterest,image-recognition",Pinterest users can now pinch-to-zoom on photos in the app,instagram,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/pinterest-users-can-now-pinch-to-zoom-on-photos-in-the-app/

Now instead of just posting a soulless “HBD” or “Happy Birthday!” on someone’s wall with no personal message, photo, memory, or anything that makes it feel sincere, you can post one of Facebook’s auto-generated, personalized birthday videos. Similar to the ones it shows on your friendversary with different people, the birthday video will show photos of you and the birthday boy/girl with stylized transitions.
These videos could make it just as easy to send something that shows you and a friend’s unique journey through life together as it does to send a generic string of text. That could make sending birthday wishes feel more authentic and valuable, and less like a boring chore. Facebook launched birthday message recap videos last year to aggregate text wall posts from all your friends into something more visual, but now each friend can send a happy birthday video.

And now when it’s your birthday, you can easily dedicate it to a charity. Two weeks before your birthday, you’ll get a prompt to choose from one of 750,000 eligible non-profits vetted by Facebook. Friends will get a notification about your fundraiser, and be able to donate on your behalf as a birthday gift.
Facebook launched the donate button in 2013, and last year let people easily set up personal fundraisers. Facebook has received some flack for charging a 6.9% + $0.30 fee, but that covers processing, security, fraud, and vetting to ensure people are giving to real charities. Facebook has told me this is not a revenue generator, and in fact its fees are lower than what other donation platforms like GoFundMe charge.

Last year Facebook said 100 million birthday wishes per day total. Birthday fundraisers could let people leverage the social obligation some users feel about sending birthday wishes, and turn that sentiment into actual good. It’s nice to see Facebook realize it’s created the “HBD” behavioral norm that wasn’t necessarily delivering much positive outcome or emotional resonance, and turn it into something more beneficial and nostalgia-inducing.",2017-08-16,1527509,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-birthdays.png?w=738,social/,,45 million people send birthday wishes on Facebook each day,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/facebook-birthday-video-fundraiser/
Jordan Crook,Social,"The events that unfolded this weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia have sparked reactions from all corners of the internet. But one Twitter user, former President Barack Obama, had a response that resonated with millions.
Last night, this tweet from Obama became the most-liked tweet on the platform ever, with more than 3 million likes at the time of writing.
Sadly, this common-sense tweet stands in direct opposition to a shocking number of people who side with the Alt-Right, including current President Donald Trump.
But what’s more interesting, perhaps, is the lens that Twitter offers us through which to view the world. In 2014, the most retweeted and liked tweets on the platform included Ellen Degeneres’ Oscars selfie.
It was followed by Justin Bieber’s… this:
This year, the second-most liked tweet was Ariana Grande’s reaction to the Manchester bombing:
To be fair, all hope is not lost. The #NuggsForCarter kid still holds the record for most retweets this year, at 3.42 million. But truthfully, that doesn’t offer much solace.
It’s depressing AF that the most-liked tweets of the year, thus far, are in reaction to terrorism and xenophobia, and say something that we should all inherently know: that all people are created equal.",2017-08-16,1527455,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-16-at-9-23-19-am.png?w=738,social/,"donald-trump,barack-obama",The most-liked tweet in history says a lot about how the world is doing,twitter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/the-most-liked-tweet-in-history-says-a-lot-about-how-the-world-is-doing/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Taking inspiration from line drawings, Reddit and Messenger, Facebook is overhauling the design of the News Feed to make it more legible, clickable and commentable. Specifically, Facebook now makes it much clearer where threads start and end in comments. Meanwhile, Instagram today got a little redesign itself with comment reels now being threaded so you can have sub-conversations in public.

Facebook periodically updates its design, typically stripping out unnecessary “chrome,” or user interface framing, to create a sleeker, more readable look. There’s more and more white space on Facebook, which could be intended to reduce eye fatigue during long browsing sessions and let your friends’ content pop off the screen more vividly.
Facebook’s design team writes “we did not want to just ‘fiddle at the edges’, but rather make something that billions of people use every day less frustrating.”
Both the Facebook and Instagram changes will roll out to all iOS and Android users over the next few weeks.



Facebook is adopting the Messenger bubble style for comments. This will make threading more obvious, but also encourage the rapid-fire conversations people typically have in private messages. Facebook has been trying to make comments feel more alive recently with fast-moving conversations becoming their own chat windows.

Facebook has made its navigation and feedback buttons bigger and easier to recognize with a new unfilled line drawing style. The News Feed, Video, Marketplace, Like, Comment and Share buttons now all feature this look. Meanwhile, Facebook is swapping the classic globe notifications icon for a more standard alerts bell. These could all be less distracting to the eye so you focus on Facebook’s content, not its chrome.

Other redesigns for legibility include higher contrast text that’s easier to see and circular profile photos that take up less space and feel more human. Link previews are now a little bigger, too, which could get more people clicking and sending referral traffic to other sites. However, Facebook says today’s changes shouldn’t impact the reach or traffic of Pages. The URL domain is now more prominent, appearing above the link’s headline, which could reduce the likelihood that users click fake/hoax sites that mimic popular news publisher URLs.

Facebook wants to make sure you don’t get lost several layers deep beyond the feed. Now you’ll see a more obvious header with a bigger black back button when you dive into a post from the News Feed. Facebook also says you’ll be able to “See where a link will take you before clicking on it,” though it already had link previews, blurbs and URLs, so we’ve asked for clarification here.

As Facebook and Instagram restyle themselves to boost usage, a question arises about design ethics. Is building a better mousetrap beneficial to society? Facebook and Instagram certainly allow communities and friend groups to grow their bonds, but when does fruitful exchange and sentimental entertainment give way to mindless scrolling?
As former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris discusses in his TED talk, over-optimization for engagement on social networks has created apps that are addictive to the point of being destructive.

Over the years I’ve repeatedly asked Facebook’s top executives like CPO Chris Cox and VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri about whether the company is doing research into how to prevent or minimize internet addiction that can stem from Facebook’s ad-driven business model, and I’ve never gotten a direct answer that indicates they think it’s a priority.
They do care about their users’ experience, with Cox telling me “We’re getting to a size where it’s worth really taking a careful look at what are all the things that we can do to make social media the most positive force for good possible.” But you can always have too much of a good thing.
The execs tell me Facebook wants to make sure all your time spent on its apps is “meaningful”. Yet at some point when people are sitting in the dark alone refreshing the feed over and over, it could be worth surfacing Internet addiction and mental health tips, or encouraging them to connect directly with a friend via messaging.
Perhaps one day our apps will be redesigned not just to soak up more attention, but to warn us when we’re neglecting everything else.",2017-08-15,1527216,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-redesign.png?w=738,social/,facebook-messenger,Facebook and Instagram get redesigns for readability,instagram,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-instagram-comments/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Facebook is again getting into the daily deals space, this time in collaboration with eBay. The company has launched a new feature within its Marketplace section on its mobile app, where a selection of inventory from eBay’s Daily Deals program is now available. The deals can be shopped directly in Facebook’s app, but checkout takes place on eBay’s website through an in-app browser.
The new addition expands the focus for Marketplace, Facebook’s answer to Craigslist. This section today is prominently positioned in Facebook’s mobile app, occupying the central spot on the bottom bar on iOS (or top bar on Android), in between the Video and Notifications icons.

Launched publicly last fall, the idea has been to aggregate the “for sale” postings from the social network’s various “buy and sell” groups, allowing for an easier, more centralized way to search and shop for items from local sellers. You can also list your own items for sale, and chat with buyers or sellers via Marketplace’s integration with Messenger.
To date, however, it has been a peer-to-peer marketplace, not a source for deals from third-party websites, like eBay.
That has now changed, as some users will see a new “Daily Deals” section when clicking into Marketplace.

 
The deals will emphasize those products in the Consumer Electronics, Fashion, and Home & Garden categories.
At the top of the page, there’s a countdown that indicates how long the deals will be available. Each item also displays the percentage off. But to see the actual sale price, you have to click into the deal itself.
There will be around 100 new items posted to this section daily, we understand. Deals can be shared with others via SMS or Messenger, which will link to the deal via eBay’s ShopBot app.
Facebook characterizes this as a test.
“We’re conducting a test to determine if people are interested in shopping for discounted products when they visit Marketplace,” said Facebook Product Manager, Akash Anand, in a statement shared with TechCrunch.
The Daily Deals feature is currently available to a small percentage of people in the U.S. as of earlier this month, and is displaying on both the Android and iOS Facebook mobile apps.

While eBay is the current source for these deals, Facebook’s arrangement with eBay is not exclusive. That means if this proves to be a popular feature, Facebook could expand Daily Deals to include those from other third parties as well.
For the time being, transaction revenue is not being shared between eBay and Facebook. Instead, users who click on a deal will be linked over to the eBay website within the Facebook app, where they can view more product details, and complete their purchase.
Daily deals is an area Facebook explored years ago, during Groupon’s heyday. The idea back then was to connect users to deals for area restaurants, shops, group activities, and more, from local businesses. But these days, businesses that want to reach customers on Facebook set up their own Pages, and run ads. Plus, the can entice users with Facebook Offers, which can also be run as ads.
The new Daily Deals section, on the other hand, gives Facebook more of a “real” shopping feature – a way to browse products from eBay’s trusted sellers, then buy right in the Facebook app.

Though a different angle on daily deals than before, it’s not the first time Facebook has dabbled with enabling commerce on its site. Most notably, the current “Shops” feature (originally called the “Shopping” feed) pulls in product listings from Facebook Pages, then lets you checkout from the seller’s own website, while still in Facebook.
Facebook has not publicly announced the Daily Deals feature, as it remains a test. It’s not clear when or if the feature may become more broadly available, but we understand it’s not connected with the European Marketplace expansion news announced yesterday.
Ebay also confirmed the test of Daily Deals on Facebook.
“At eBay, we are always looking to broaden our reach and surface inventory through new channels,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently running a test with a small subset of people on Facebook in the U.S. who can browse eBay’s Daily Deals on Facebook Marketplace.”",2017-08-15,1527155,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/fb-dollar-sign-mobile-alt1.png?w=738,social/,"e-commerce,facebook-marketplace,ebay",Facebook adds eBay’s Daily Deals to its Marketplace on mobile,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-adds-ebays-daily-deals-to-its-marketplace-on-mobile/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Veo, a Copenhagen-based startup, wants to “democratise the recording of football”. By taking advantage of developments in AI and video camera technology, the company offers a solution for amateur soccer clubs that want to video and stream matches and training sessions without the need for a camera operator or vision mixer/editor.
The Veo camera mount consists of two 4K cameras encased within a 3D-printed box, designed to be positioned on a four-metre tripod just outside of the pitch’s halfway line. The cameras then record a 180-degree panoramic view of the full pitch, with the resulting image stitched together and the AI-tech working hard to follow the action via virtual panning and zooming on the resulting recording video file.
That, of course, means that a portion of the image will often be cropped out, resulting in a loss of resolution overall. However, the idea is that by starting with 4K the resulting video quality is more than sufficient, not least for playback on smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets.
“Today, less than 1 per cent of all football matches are recorded,” says Veo co-founder and CEO Henrik Teisbæk. “This is because in order to record a football match properly, you need a cameraman to be filming from an elevated position for 90 mins, and then be able to edit the footage afterwards. Most teams simply don’t have the resources required for this, meaning that millions of goals and unique footballing moments are never viewed or shared by the players”.

To get around this, Teisbæk says Veo’s AI technology can detect where the action is on the field, and automatically zoom and pan to follow the ball – just like a camera operator would do. “We have spent nearly two years developing the technology to detect where on the pitch a camera operator would point and zoom,” he explains.
“Using deep neural networks and computer vision, our tech can now track the ball and players with consistency and precision. This is combined with advanced video editing techniques, so we can zoom and pan inside the full panoramic video and ‘crop’ out the relevant part”.
Despite the aforementioned loss of quality, the advantage of this approach is that the Veo cameras can record from a static position, and don’t need to pan and tilt during the recording. It also means coaches and players can manually create their own edits after the match, by choosing the virtual camera angle and where to zoom.
“Since the zooming is done digitally, the output pixel quality is reduced. However it’s important to stress that the recordings are not meant for professional TV broadcasting and that the reduced video quality format works really well on devices with smaller screens,” reiterates Teisbæk.
The startup’s business model is based on subscription fees from football clubs. The entry camera subscription will starts from £999 annually. Clubs can upgrade to embed their local sponsors’ logos onto the match videos and highlights, which could also provide those clubs with a welcome additional revenue stream.
Meanwhile, I’m told Veo has raised a total of €2 million in seed funding to date, with Copenhagen-based Seed Capital most recently investing €1.1 million in April 2017. The remaining €900,000 came via angel investors including: David Fellah (Founder of Designit); Per Zachariassen (Founder of Blu and Skylark); Henrik Hancke (Founder of Blu and Skylark); and Kasper Wedendahl (Founder of Bacon).",2017-08-30,1532848,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tripod.jpg?w=738,europe/,,Veo uses AI to let amateur soccer clubs video matches without the need for a camera operator,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/veo/
Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh,Europe,"

Last November I covered how Europe’s VR meetup community has more than doubled in its member base of freelancers, startups and companies. The booming region has given rise to the likes of EUVR, a nonprofit organization dedicated to maturing the VR industry in Europe by offering platforms and resources to help address issues like its increasingly fragmented ecosystem. Its first platform to debut in April was an interactive database that offers the kind of visibility that is often sorely lacking in an emerging tech space. A leading Japanese mobile game studio, Gumi, is supporting the EUVR with investment and resources that translates into a healthy vote of confidence on the value-add that the database offers the region’s rapidly growing VR community.
“Europe has the potential to become a leading region in VR content: Our creativity, our cultural heritage and our talents are all assets that can be used to create unforgettable VR experiences, amazing video games and disruptive B2B applications. We feel this database can help support the growth of this industry in Europe,” Juan Bossicard, co-founder of EUVR, told me.
Last February, Silicon Valley-based venture firm, The Venture Reality Fund, released its first European VR landscape in partnership with LucidWeb, a Belgian VR and WebVR consulting and development agency. It was the result of extensive research and information gathered in correspondence with regional VR ambassadors across Europe, and at the time it tracked about 300 active companies in the region.
Now, six months later, that figure has jumped to 487 companies, of which 188 are featured in the landscape (up from 116). More than half of these movers and shakers are based in the United Kingdom (46), France (29), Sweden (19) and Germany (15). The selection criteria to appear on the list required that a company received formal funding and has a commercial product on the market.",2017-08-29,1531154,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/virtual-reality-image.jpg?w=738,europe/,,Europe’s VR landscape continues to grow rapidly despite market slowdown,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/europes-vr-landscape-continues-to-grow-rapidly-despite-market-slowdown/
"Devin Coldewey,Frederic Lardinois",Artificial Intelligence,"Tech giants Google, Microsoft and Facebook are all applying the lessons of machine learning to translation, but a small company called DeepL has outdone them all and raised the bar for the field. Its translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition, but more accurate and nuanced than any we’ve tried.
I only speak a smattering of French in addition to my passable English, but luckily my colleague Frederic is a man of many tongues. We both agreed that DeepL’s translations were generally superior to those from Google Translate and Bing.
Take, for example, the following passage from a German news article, as rendered by DeepL (top) and Google:
 
As Frederic puts it: “Whereas Google Translate often goes for a very literal translation that misses some nuances and idioms (or gets the translation of these idioms dead wrong), DeepL often provides a more natural translation that comes closer to that of a trained translator.”
The second sentence is parsed more naturally; the measure is “designed to” accomplish something rather than just doing that thing; the police are “on the road in armoured vehicles” as opposed to merely on them; “martial appearance” may be imperfect (though inspired) but it’s far better than the nonsensical “fighters’ turmoil…had come to the fore.”
A few tests of my own on some French literature I know well enough to judge had DeepL coming out on top regularly, as well. Fewer errors of tense, intent and agreement, plus a better understanding and deployment of idiom make for a much more readable translation. We thought so, and so did translators in DeepL’s own blind testing. But don’t take anyone else’s word for it — test it out yourself.
While it’s true that meaning can be conveyed successfully despite errors of that class, as evidenced by the utility we’ve all found in even the poorest machine translations, it’s far from guaranteed that anything but the barest facts of will make it through.
DeepL was born from the similarly excellent Linguee, a translation tool that has existed for years and, while popular, never quite reached the level of Google Translate — the latter has a huge advantage in brand and position, after all. Linguee’s co-founder, Gereon Frahling, used to work for Google Research but left in 2007 to pursue this new venture.
The team has been working with machine learning for years, for tasks adjacent to the core translation, but it was only last year that they began working in earnest on a whole new system and company, both of which would bear the name DeepL.
In an email, Frahling told me that the time was ripe: “We have built a neural translation network that incorporates most of the latest developments, to which we added our own ideas.”
An enormous database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a method of ground-truthing translations by searching for similar snippets on the web, made for a strong base in the training of the new model. They also put together what they claim is the 23rd most powerful supercomputer in the world, conveniently located in Iceland.
Developments published by universities, research agencies and indeed Linguee’s competitors showed that convolutional neural networks were the way to go, rather than the recurrent neural networks the company had been using previously. Now isn’t really the place to go into the differences between CNNs and RNNs, so it must suffice to say that for accurate translation of long, complex strings of related words, the former is a better bet as long as you can control for its weaknesses.
For example, a CNN could roughly be able to be said to tackle one word of the sentence at a time. This becomes a problem when, for instance, as commonly happens, a word at the end of the sentence determines how a word at the beginning of the sentence should be formed. It’s wasteful to go through the whole sentence only to find that the first word the network picked is wrong, and then start over with that knowledge, so DeepL and others in the machine learning field apply “attention mechanisms” that monitor for such potential trip-ups and resolve them before the CNN moves on to the next word or phrase.
There are other secret techniques in play, of course, and their result is a translation tool that I personally plan to make my new default. I look forward to seeing the others step up their game.",2017-08-29,1533081,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/whisper-layoffs1.jpg?w=738,europe/,"deepl,machine-learning,translation",DeepL schools other online translators with clever machine learning,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/

Mike Butcher,Europe,"The Blockchain was created as an open-source, free, decentralized accounting system where transactions are recorded across multiple computers. Its first use was for tracking the first genuine crypto-currency, Bitcoin, but it could be could be adapted to track anything, including, for instance, electrons. So, for instance, if you can automatically record the flow of electricity units between charging stations and cars, you can support the growing infrastructure of charging stations.
Another is that to make autonomous driving truly viable, you will need an open platform to hand over data between you, the car, the vehicle owner (less and less likely to be you), infrastructure providers, insurers, you name it. The Blockchain could be perfect for this. Thus, now startups are appearing which plan to leverage these ideas.
A new UK startups intends to do just that. DOVU aims to become “the global marketplace for transport data.” It’s planning a token sale on 3 Oct, 2017, which will fund its distributed marketplace for the “give and take of transport-related APIs”, powered by the “DOV” token.
Now, while there as many token sales, and many other startups in mobility right now, what sets DOVU apart is that it is well-connected in the transport sector. In April 2017, DOVU received seed funding from InMotion Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s investment arm, and Creative England, a fund backed by the UK Government.
Founder and CEO Irfon Watkins is a serial entrepreneur who has founded and sold companies across the API spectrum, including the large-scale ad-platform Coull. His advisory board includes Lars Klawitter, General Manager of Rolls Royce Bespoke, who is also a director of the Ethereum Foundation, no less. DOVU also includes co-founder and CMO Arwen Smit, and co-founder and COO Krasina Mileva.
Right now transport data is locked up on multiple platforms. By using blockchain technology, DOVU aims to provide trust for corporates or individuals by opening up the availability of all these data sets for public and enterprise use. The DOVU system works by creating a distributed marketplace for transport data. That would mean vehicle hire, insurance companies, ride-sharing and others could be connected to create a network of transport-related data resources. This shared data becomes more valuable because it’s shared, not because it’s locked into one platform. That could spell an interesting question for companies like Uber. Imagine if you created a sort of ‘federated Uber”?
Watkins says: “The transport sector knows where it wants to go with real-time data and smart technology but doesn’t know how to get there! DOVU is the missing piece of the puzzle – an on-ramp for fast, secure and global data sharing for everybody.”
With DOVU you could, for example, combine car data with insurance data to calculate smarter policies, or use geolocation data in conjunction with weather statistics to inform ride-hailing companies.
Similar to using an in-game currency, contributors could be rewarded with tokens based on the quality of their input.
That implies things like having a Smartphone app which not only unlocks a shared vehicle, and automatically signs you in to the DOVU platform, but would allow you to sell or share the car’s data while driving.
It could even allow to track your movements (walking, running, cycling, driving) and then let you sell this data in return for DOV Tokens that can be used to buy petrol, train journeys or bus rides. Get walking, to fund your car habit…
As you can see it’s a brave new mobility world out there.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"There are an increasing number of startups trying to bring more transparency — and, dare I say it, disruption — to various element of sea freight or the shipping industry. These include Freightos, the well-funded freight marketplace and freight-forwarding quote price comparison site, and, more recently, Shipamax, which is trying to drag bulk shipping into the digital age.
Now we can add BunkerEx to the list, a newly funded startup out of London that is building an online marketplace to change the way shipping companies buy fuel, or ‘bunkers,’ to use the correct industry term. In what is being described as a “pre-seed” round, the company has raised £400,000 from early-stage investor Seedcamp, and the taxpayer-funded London Co-Investment Fund, along with a number of unnamed angel investors.
“I’ve been in the oil and shipping industry for nearly ten years now, most recently working four years at the largest bunker trader in the world,” BunkerEx co-founder and CEO Ishaan Hemnani tells TechCrunch. “That’s really where I learnt the ropes of this opaque industry and saw first-hand how a lack of transparency was significantly costing shipping companies”.
To put into context how opaque the buying and selling of bunkers is, Hemnani says that currently most shipping companies go to brokers to buy fuel for their ships in the same way you might use a mortgage or insurance broker, but with a key difference: the bunker market is entirely unregulated.
The result is that “brokers don’t choose vendors objectively but instead based on their own relationships,” meaning that although brokers should be acting in the interest of buyers (i.e. the shipping companies), they often give them a higher price in order to increase commissions.
“Shipping companies never see the conversations between their broker and the supplier, and this ultimately costs them,” he says.
To address this, BunkerEx operates an online marketplace that matches supply and demand in a more direct way, bypassing traditional bunker brokers, even if in some says it also resembles one itself (the startup’s website even uses the tagline “The world’s most transparent bunker broker”).
Explains Hemnani: “We’ve built a marketplace where buyers post their request on the site, and based on several parameters, such as the port, dates and fuel type, we show them a full list of our verified suppliers. They can then send the request to all suppliers in one click, who get invited into a live auction to openly compete for the deal. It’s like Alibaba for bunker fuel!”.
All offers are then transmitted in real-time, and once the buyer sees an offer they like, they accept it and the auction for that request ends. Noteworthy, suppliers are kept anonymous to each other and buyers can also give a counter price to all suppliers at once as leverage on a first to accept wins basis.
“Besides the monetary benefits, there’s also a huge amount of time saved as a buyer can reach out to a large number of suppliers and fix a deal in minutes,” adds the BunkerEx CEO. “Traditionally this is all done over instant messenger (such as Skype Chat, although it used to be Yahoo! Messenger) so there is a lot of back-and-forth on different chat windows. We estimate that our platform saves a buyer an average of 40 minutes per deal”.
Meanwhile, I’m told that a total of 400 million tonnes of fuel is delivered to ships every year, so BunkerEx is going after a potentially huge market. Repeat business shouldn’t be an issue either, with shippers typically needing to refuel vessels several times per week.
And despite going up against traditional bunker brokers, Hemnani explains that BunkerEx hasn’t ditched an important element of what they offer, which is ensuring the quality and reliability of fuel suppliers. “Ultimately fuel is pumped onto a ship and a lot can go wrong with the delivery, so we still employ experts who are on call for our clients 24/7 to deal with any issues. That way we offer shipping companies all the benefits of using a broker, without having to pay the price for it,” he says.
To that end, BunkerEx says it charges a fixed commission to the supplier but doesn’t charge the buyer anything. Furthermore, that commission is said to be 80 per cent less than the fee a traditional bunker broker takes, with these savings returned back to the buyer. “Keep in mind that fuel makes up approximately 70 per cent of the cost of a voyage, so there’s a large incentive to reduce these costs,” adds Hemnani.",2017-08-29,1532184,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-600101128.jpg?w=738,europe/,bunkerex,BunkerEx is an online marketplace for shipping companies that need to buy fuel,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunkerex/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Bunch, a newly-launched startup operating out of Berlin, is aiming to be something akin to a “Google Analytics for company culture”. It offers a SaaS to let companies and company teams quantify internal company culture, and then use this data as the basis to screen job candidates to help ensure that they will also be a good fit.
Specifically, by mapping company culture data against that provided by a job applicant, the idea, Bunch founder and CEO Darja Gutnick tells me, is to be able to highlight any potential cultural fit issues that can be teased out during a subsequent interview. The software itself is based on the “organizational culture diagnosis” model developed by Charles O’Reilly from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
Gutnick says that during her time as a researcher and consultant for “high-growth startups”, she realized that a strong company culture is at the core of every successful team. However, creating the right company culture starts with hiring the right people, but it is a challenge for many companies to figure out who really is a fit for their team. Evaluating candidates based on a CV and numerous rounds of interviews alone just doesn’t cut it.
The way Bunch works is as follows: A company signs to the Saas and its teams take a 5-minute culture assessment, based on the O’Reilly model. Then, using the data provided, Bunch creates a culture profile for the company and each of its teams, mapped onto 6 key dimensions: Results-orientation, Adaptability, Collaborative, Detail-orientation, Principles and Customer-orientation. Every new applicant is tasked with taking an automated culture quiz that Bunch checks against the team and company profile.
Using the resulting Bunch report, which details the candidate’s “behavioral tendencies” as well their potential fit with the company, the premise is that hiring managers can make more informed decisions but also use any conflicts as a jumping off point during a subsequent interview to really drill down into how well they integrate or what cultural value they could in fact add.
For example, someone very detailed oriented and rigid might not seem a fit for a fast-moving super early startup, but actually, within a particular team and by being aware of and talking through the potential conflict at interview, it could be the exact attribute a team needs. Or so the thinking goes.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Skidos, an edtech startup based in Copenhagen after relocating its HQ from New Delhi, offers an SDK to help games developers turn casual games into “learning apps”. The idea, co-founder and CEO Aditya Prakash says, is to flip the existing model where educational games often do a poor job of mimicking popular non-educational gaming titles. Thus, instead of gamifying existing learning content as it moves into the digital domain, Skidos wants to make it easier to put the learning content into casual gaming.
“After launching our first in-house educational game in 2014, I quickly realised that making fun, high quality games was very time consuming and expensive,” he explains. “However at the same time, we had strong evidence that 5-12 year old kids really found the game engaging and useful to practice math. We used this evidence to pivot towards developing our proprietary SDK which can convert popular mobile games into fun educational games”.
The Skidos SDK, which is initially focusing on maths, soft launched at the Nordic Game conference in May 2016 where, Prakash says, the startup got a “phenomenal response” from game developers. The first version of the SDK was then given a more formal launch that August and since then Skidos has partnered with 10 international game studios and has launched 9 converted games on the App Stores.
“If a pupil plays one of Skidos’ games for ten weeks or more, their accuracy level in math questions will, on average, go up by four percent besides increasing the time spent on practicing skills,” claims the Skidos founder.
But exactly how does the SDK let developers convert a casual game into a bona fide learning app?
In terms of the actual learning content, it has been designed as a replacement for worksheets and is mapped to popular maths curriculums. Specifically, once the game developer integrates the SDK, the learning content gets triggered at specific events when the child needs to advance in the game or win the virtual currency or special power up of the game — see the video embedded below.
From a technical perspective, it’s offered as a Unity package file which has its own Graphical User Interface (GUI) and libraries which communicate with the Skidos servers.
For example, Prakash argues that a game like Super Mario can teach children mathematical concepts of speed, distance, time, costs, height etc because they engage with these concepts in the game. “We have created many such concepts around mathematics along with other standard mathematics curriculum inside the SDK,” he says.
“There are companies who have tried to develop their own fun learning games but have failed to build a scalable business model,” adds Prakash. “At the same time, kids in the age group of 6-13 years are gamified since birth and spend an average of 2 hours daily playing casual games. We want to create learning opportunities for them during this time without compromising on gameplay or fun”.
To further that mission, Skidos has raised $750,000 in new funding. Leading the round are SEED Capital Denmark, with participation from unnamed Danish angel investors.

Mike Butcher,Artificial Intelligence,"Price comparison websites for insurance products have been around for many years. However, typically, people buy from these based just on price, with zero customization based on the person. What’s required is a much more tailor-made service, changing the culture from strictly price-only focused to the “best cover for you.”
That’s the pitch of U.K. startup Sherpa (CrunchBase), which has secured $2.3 million in seed funding from InsurTech.VC and number of angels.
Sherpa — which has yet to launch — has an AI-driven platform that builds a personalized risk profile of an individual. This is constantly updated for members, informs them of changes in risk and the costs of protecting against those risks. It has a partnership with reinsurance giant Gen Re, and has also removed the commission insurance companies typically take, passing this saving back to the consumer.
It’s playing in a similar space to Lemonade in the U.S., which is also attacking the insurance market in innovative ways.
The idea is that Sherpa flips the insurance model on its head, insuring people, not products.
Historically, risk cover is put into packages and then sold with just a few customizable areas. Most of the customizations work for the benefit of the insurer rather than the consumer.
Chris Kaye, CEO and co-founder of Sherpa says they are “doing away with the concept of the insurance ‘product’ and inventing a new, holistic way of underwriting risk. To traditional insurers, you are just the sum of your policies. At Sherpa, we treat each of our members as a unique person whose risks change all the time.”
Kaye previously spent 15 years advising insurance companies as the partner and managing director of Boston Consulting Group’s Asia Insurance practice.
Mehrdad Piroozram, an entrepreneur and partner at InsurTech.VC, says of his investment, “Sherpa has assembled a fantastic team of industry veterans, tech geeks, mathematicians, data wizards and marketing gurus — it’s the best team we have seen in InsurTech.”
Sherpa will operate across all insurance sectors, including home, health, life, travel, car, devices and pets.",2017-08-25,1531692,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/insurance.jpg?w=738,europe/,,Sherpa secures $2.3M to build AI-driven insurance platform tailored to individuals,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/sherpa-secures-2-3m-to-build-ai-driven-insurance-platform-tailored-to-individuals/
Catherine Shu,Europe,"Flytrex wants to prove that drones are a realistic option for on-demand logistics with a new delivery program that took flight in Iceland’s capital today. While other companies, including Amazon, have tested drone deliveries, Flytrex says this is the first time a fully operational on-demand drone delivery service has launched in an urban area. Drones will take orders from online marketplace AHA’s headquarters in Reykjavik to a destination two miles away during the project’s first phase.
Headquartered in Tel Aviv, Flytrex raised a $3 million Series A earlier this year for its drone technology. Its drones were approved by the Icelandic Transport Authority to pick up orders from restaurants and stores on one side of Reykjavik and fly them to a designated drop-off point in the suburb of Grafarvogur.
Flytrex CEO and co-founder Yariv Bash says Reykjavik is a good place to test the efficiency of drone deliveries because parts of the city are separated by a bay. Drivers often need to navigate around the shoreline, but drones can just fly over the water. Deliveries that would usually take 25 minutes by car in Reykjavik can be completed by a Flytrex drone in only four minutes, the company claims. Not only are deliveries faster, but they can also more cost-efficient. Bash says AHA has already seen a 60 percent in cost per delivery by using drones.
Drones can handle packages that weigh up to 3 kg and are a bit larger than a shoebox, so deliveries are currently best suited for smaller orders or restaurant food. During the first part of the Reykjavik program, Flytrex will fly one drone that will make 20 deliveries per day for AHA, before adding more over the next few weeks. Its goal is to make hundreds of deliveries per day directly to customers’ yards within a few months.
Backyard deliveries are possible in Reykjavik because much of the city is suburban. Flytrex’s drones use smart mapping to adapt to other environments and operate at about 50 meters in the air, which means they can clear most obstacles. Bash says Flytrex is already working on a project in an area with many high-rise buildings and is currently seeking approval from regulators in European, South American and Central American countries.
“In high-rise environments like Manhattan, the most likely scenario is to have drones deliver packages at the entrance to buildings or on rooftops, which our system is already capable of doing technologically speaking,” he says. “We believe that regulators approving city-wide drone delivery in high-rise urban environments is just around the corner.”",2017-08-23,1530871,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/flytrex-iceland-drone-delivery-4.png?w=738,europe/,"iceland,drone,flytrex",Flytrex launches an autonomous on-demand drone delivery service in Iceland’s capital,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/flytrex-launches-an-autonomous-on-demand-drone-delivery-service-in-icelands-capital/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"Google Maps on Android and iOS now has a new transportation option. If you live in a country where French startup BlaBlaCar operates, you can now open the BlaBlaCar app and book a ride straight from Google Maps.
Google isn’t adding a new tab just for BlaBlaCar. Instead, BlaBlaCar appears as a new option in the public transportation tab. For instance, if you’re looking at ways to go from Paris to Lyon, Google Maps suggests taking the TGV train — and now also BlaBlaCar.
The app gives you an ETA for each transportation mode so that you can compare how long it’s going to take if you opt for the train or BlaBlaCar. Google Maps uses the same ETA for BlaBlaCar and a normal car ride. It also estimates the cost of a BlaBlaCar ride.
BlaBlaCar is a ridesharing service for long-distance rides between two cities. It has tens of millions of members in dozens of countries. Think about it as a sort of Airbnb for carpooling.
When you are driving from one city to another, BlaBlaCar can help you find people for those empty seats in your car. Conversely, if you’re looking for a cheap transportation option, you can open the BlaBlaCar app or website and book a seat in someone’s car.
The startup takes a cut on each transaction. With today’s integration, if somebody books a ride through Google Maps, BlaBlaCar is paying Google a small referral fee.
Google Maps also integrates with Uber in its own dedicated tab. BlaBlaCar doesn’t get its own tab, but it should still help a bit when it comes to growth and engagement.

Steve O'Hear,Apps,"Home, a Berlin-based startup that offers an app to help landlords manage their properties, has raised €3 million in seed funding. EQT Ventures led the round, along with the company’s existing investor, Redalpine.
Claiming to already have more than 100,000 apartments being managed through its app since the company was founded last year, Home aims to remove some of the hassle associated with letting out a property, not just for property owners but also tenants.
As it stands, the publicly-released version of the iOS and Android app lets landlords automatically tracks rent payments — via connecting to 3,000 or so German banks — as well as being alerted to late or missing payments, and continuously monitoring the value of properties. However, in a call, co-founder and CEO Thilo Konzok said that the vision is much bigger: to provide the best housing experiences for tenants and landlords alike.
That mission perhaps hints to Konzok and Home’s other co-founder Moritz von Hase’s background both as a landlord and in architecture. Konzok explained that the pair hope to use technology to improve housing in a scalable way, starting with the administration pain-point of landlords (i.e. collecting and tracking rental income) in order to entice them to the app.
Other areas Home wishes to help with include home design and improvement, in a bid to improve existing rental housing stock, and an app for tenants to make it a lot easier to rent a home and deal with amenities such as Wifi and utility billing. Some of these offerings are currently being tested privately in a very narrow beta, although Konzok declined to go into further details at this stage.
“Since we can’t buy or build every apartment, we wanted to enable landlords to provide better housing experiences. Making apartment management simpler and more enjoyable for landlords was a natural first step in our journey. We’re also excited about opening the platform to tenants soon and making renting an apartment a much better experience,” the Home CEO says.
Lars Jornow, a Partner and investment advisor to EQT Ventures, cites Konzok and von Hase’s energy and drive and “deep understanding” of the German property market as part of the reason for choosing to invest in Home.
That’s something I can testify after Konzok and I managed to wax lyrical for half an hour talking about how broken the U.K. rental market is compared to Germany (although he thinks Germany also needs to further deregulate its planning laws in order to incentivise more housing stock being built for a rental sector that is also feeling the strain of a lack of supply).",2017-08-22,1528917,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/office-with-founders-cto-moritz-von-hase-left-ceo-thilo-konzok-right-1.jpg?w=738,europe/,home,Berlin-based Home is an app to help landlords manage properties and improve the rental experience,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/berlin-based-home/
Mike Butcher,Europe,"UK fintech startup Prodigy Finance has raised a whopping $240 million funding round, certainly one of the largest by a UK company this year. The company provides loans to international students from emerging markets, enabling them to study at business schools in the US, the UK and Europe.
The fundraise includes a $40 million Series C equity round led by London’s Index Ventures, with participation from Balderton Capital and AlphaCode, an accelerator in Africa; and a $200 million debt facility led by an unnamed “global investment bank”.
With the number of international students forecast to reach 8 million by 2025 Prodigy Finance is clearly sitting on a growing market.
The company founded what it describes as the world’s first globally enforceable credit model, and works only with leading universities. The annual repayment rate of over 99% is ensured by crowdfunding loans from alumni from universities such as such as INSEAD, London Business School, Cambridge Judge Business School, Stanford University and Harvard University.
That means students are ‘reputationally invested’ in their own education, and it allows alumni to support their alma mater. Qualified investors, and the alumni, also earn a financial return. It’s Philanthropy 2.0, if you will.
Prodigy assesses applicants based on their projected earnings, not their credit history. That opens up education to literally anyone, and is especially geared to those from emerging markets.
In the last ten years it’s provided more than $325 million in funding to over 7,100 students, 78 per cent of whom come from emerging markets. The firm is currently increasing its US footprint, where international students contributed $32.8 billion and 400,000 jobs to the US economy during the 2015-2016 academic year.
Cameron Stevens, Founder and CEO of Prodigy Finance, said: “Students from emerging economies such as China, Brazil and India face challenges in accessing financing for education, even with high credentials and excellent credit quality. This investment will help us double the size of our student portfolio. We believe in financial inclusion and talent mobility, and look forward to continuing to help international students break the funding barrier and further their education at a top international university.”
Ilian Mihov, Dean of INSEAD, said: “Prodigy Finance has worked with INSEAD for almost ten years now. About 25% of our students are funded by Prodigy Finance loans and they come from all over the world, many from countries where it would be difficult to get a bank loan or other forms of financing. It’s an important source of funding at INSEAD and helps contribute to diversity, as we have over 90 different nationalities represented. Diversity is essential to our DNA, as it’s a source of creativity and understanding.”",2017-08-22,1529618,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/gettyimages-465727260.jpg?w=738,europe/,index-ventures,UK’s Prodigy Finance raises $240M to crowdfund students from emerging markets,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/uks-prodigy-finance-raises-240m-to-crowdfund-students-from-emerging-markets/
Steve O'Hear,Apps,"London-based startup Acasa has come a long way since we covered its seed round in late 2015. The company, then called Splittable, offered a way to manage and share household expenses with multiple house members. However, the bigger vision was to build a platform for ‘Generation Rent’ that makes moving from one houseshare to another as easy as logging in and out of the Acasa app. A spew of recent updates (including the name change itself) are seeing that vision begin to come into focus.
Within the Acasa web and mobile apps, household members in the U.K. can set up, manage and split costs for their energy, broadband, water and TV license provision, whilst I’m told Council Tax will be added soon. To achieve this, the startup has partnered with a number of ‘challenger services,’ including broadband company Origin, and green energy provider Octopus Energy. It’s also penned a partnership with Virgin Media to offer the telco’s broadband services directly in the Acasa app.
“Running a home sucks, it’s still analogue, archaic, and arduous,” Acasa co-founder and CEO Nicholas Katz tells me. “One person always gets screwed over by having to be the one in charge of bills/finances (which also means they take on all the credit risk which most renters don’t realise!). Eight days of every year of your life are wasted dealing with home finances, setting up bills, talking to providers, chasing people you live with for money”.
That pain-point was one Katz says he’s experienced directly as a bonafide member of Generation Rent. He claims to have rented 17 homes and lived with over 50 housemates in 4 different countries (U.S., U.K., Israel, Germany). “I’m an “expert” at dealing with housemate and shared housing issues,” he jokes.
To get started with the Acasa app you register a user profile and then choose from the types of services you want to set up. Currently this includes energy, Internet, TV license, water, with more coming soon. After adding some basic information about your home (ie how many people you live with, number of rooms, etc.), Acasa will provide a quote for all of these services.
After a home is set up, a digital “magnet” for each supplier appears on the Acasa dashboard, which you click on to adjust how the cost is split between the people in your home or to learn more about the supplier.
Then when the bill is due, the magnet on the home will adjust automatically to represent how much each of you owe to the service provider, and each person is automatically charged the agreed portion of the bill and the money is collected by Acasa and sent to the supplier in one lump sum.
“The magnet sets back to zero and it’s happy living until the next month’s bill is due,” explains Katz.
The ultimate goal, however, is to make setting up a new home a one-click affair, with all of your required services automatically signed up to and trackable. A “technology layer for the home,” is how Katz describes it, something akin to the way co-working space provider WeWork has built what it calls a co-working Operating System. A convenience layer might also be an apt description.
The other aspect to Acasa as a platform is that you only need to make a user profile once, meaning that your Acasa credentials move house with you, either so you can be added to an existing Acasa-powered houseshare or create a new household of your own. That not only helps to make the app sticky but is a potential viral loop, too.
Meanwhile, since launching in 2015, the company has grown to a team of 9, with over 150,000 app downloads and on average tracks £5 million in home costs every month. In addition, I’m told that Acasa’s peer-to-peer money transfer service, which is only available to users in the U.K., despite the app being global, now averages £50,000 a month.
The startup is publicly backed to the tune of $1.2 million from VCs Seedcamp, Playfair Capital, the London Co-Investment Fund and a number of angel investors, but I understand has since closed a further follow-on investment round for an undisclosed amount. I’m also hearing that Acasa is currently raising additional funding, most likely a fully-fledged Series A.
“I love the idea of leveraging technology to help people live better at home. It’s amazing to feel and hear how we are genuinely helping people improve their relationships with the people they live with as well as the suppliers they usually have an absolutely fucking miserable time with — think back to the last joyful moment you had talking to one of your utility companies,” adds the Acasa CEO.",2017-08-22,1529025,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ios-2.png?w=738,europe/,"splittable,acasa",Acasa is building a platform for ‘Generation Rent’ to manage their homes,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/acasa/
Mike Butcher,Europe,"Sometimes the most obvious solutions might be the best. While the U.S. wrings its hands over what to do with online haters and abusers on social media, other countries have a more direct approach: throw the book at them. That’s effectively the U.K.’s new approach, which will now treat online “hate crime” as seriously as offenses carried out in real life.
The U.K.’s director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, said the Crown Prosecution Service, which prosecutes criminals for the state, will ask courts to consider tougher penalties for those who use social platforms like Twitter, Facebook and others to hurl abuse at people. The new plans do not require Parliament to pass new legislation. And, for once, this doesn’t involve the government hurling abuse at the social platforms themselves.
The innovation, if you want to think of it in that way, is mainly to do with the U.K.’s interpretation of free speech. In the U.S., the first amendment allows you to say basically anything, as long as it’s not immediately dangerous or directly threatening to someone. That means you can burn a cross or two, or walk around shouting racist slogans, so long as no one gets hurt at the time. Paradoxically, no connection is made between that and any real-world consequences, and the law has never been updated for the rapid spread of these ideas through radio, TV or the internet.
In the U.K. that just doesn’t wash. So, for instance, there’s a law against “incitement to racial hatred,” which is a criminal offense. The new CPS rules mean that the law now applies to anything said online, as well as offline. There also is a law against “incitement to religious hatred,” in case you were wondering.
Writing in the Guardian, Saunders said: “Left unchallenged, even low-level offending can subsequently fuel the kind of dangerous hostility that has been plastered across our media in recent days.” That is why countering it is a priority for the CPS. “Whether shouted in their face on the street, daubed on a wall or tweeted into their living room, hateful abuse can have a devastating impact on victims.”
She referred specifically to the extremist hate seen in Charlottesville in the United States recently, saying the new rules were needed because there is a direct correlation between online abuse and violence.
Saunders said the new plans were based on the growing need to protect those online from crimes such as abuse, as people spend an increasing proportion of their lives on the internet. In addition, there is a realization that abuse in the virtual world has real-world consequences, with the spreading of fear online resulting in acts of physical violence.
In a world of grotesque physical attacks that may appear a heavy-handed approach to some. But perhaps we should ask the question, what is it that the perpetrators seek to achieve? One common thread that links online purveyors of hate with those who commit physical hate crimes or real-world terrorists is “the desire to undermine and instil fear in those they target,” both individually and collectively in their communities, because of their characteristics, be that “race, religion, gender, sexuality and even disability,” she wrote.
The CPS intends for the new guidance to generate more prosecutions, with longer sentences for those convicted, thus leading to some level of prevention.
The new guidance covers hate crime pertaining to race, religion, disability and crimes that are homophobic, biphobic and transphobic.
Government figures have shown a 20 percent rise in hate crimes reported to the U.K. police in the first quarter this year, and these figures are considered to be highly under-reported.
The U.K. is perhaps heading in the direction of Germany.
Public displays of Nazi and Communist symbols are banned in Germany, and Holocaust denial is punishable by up to five years in prison. Inciting hatred or violence against anyone for their ethnic or religious identity is also a crime.
In July, German government officials ordered the police to carry out a nationwide crackdown on racist or xenophobic social postings. They raided the homes of 36 people suspected of being behind the posts, but no arrests were made.
Germany also has approved a new bill that punishes social networking sites if they fail to swiftly remove illegal content such as hate speech or defamatory fake news. If infracted, the laws impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($53.4 million) on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.
Germany’s latest solution is much more heavy-handed on tech platforms, when it seems smarter to simply remind people to be respectful of each other’s views and ask them to debate in a civilized manner. And if they can’t do that, then they can go to jail. Or perhaps that’s too much to ask these days?",2017-08-21,1529309,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/anti-hate.jpg?w=738,europe/,hate-crime,Online hate crime to be treated the same as face-to-face crime in the UK,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/online-hate-crime-to-be-treated-the-same-as-face-to-face-crime-in-the-uk/
