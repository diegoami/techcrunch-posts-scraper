Matt Burns,Gadgets,"Apple is preparing to announce a new series of iPhone at an event next week. Two models are on tap and TechCrunch has learned from trusted sources the more expensive, fancier version will ship at a later time.
It’s unclear how long will separate the availability of the two different versions. Several reports have surfaced over the last few weeks pointing to supply issues and production glitches that could be the reason for the delay.
Today The Wall Street Journal stated that a glitch in the manufacturing process pushed back the iPhone’s production by a month. Reportedly the issue stems from the decision to use OLED screens while also trying to integrate a fingerprint scanner into the screen itself. This process was apparently abandoned and the new iPhone will ship without a fingerprint scanner.
Apple apparently requires the screens to be made in a different fashion than what Samsung uses for its phones. For the iPhone, Apple separates the display and touch panel instead of integrating them together. This requires more steps to make each unit.
The new screens add another layer of complication outside of the manufacturing process. They’re apparently very expensive. As Romain pointed out earlier today, KGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple is paying $45 to $55 for LCD displays in current iPhone models. But Samsung is asking for $120 and $130 per unit. This could be the reason why the next high-end iPhone is going to be so expensive.
Reports have suggested that the more expensive iPhone could top $1,000. This would be the version that would be released after the standard model.
New iPhones are always in short supply when they are first available and that’s likely to remain true with this version. By staggering the release and selling one phone at a much higher price, Apple could relieve some of the pressure on its supply chain to process and fulfill orders.",2017-09-07,1537576,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mkbhd-iphone-8-dummy-unit.png?w=738,gadgets/,iphone,High-end iPhone to ship after standard models,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/high-end-iphone-to-ship-after-standard-models/
Matthew Lynley,Gadgets,"Fitbit today came out with some additional news that might give Wall Street some signs of life as it looks to compete with an increasingly complicated fitness tracking environment — and the stock is surging this afternoon as a result.
Fitbit’s shares are up more than 11 percent after it announced a partnership with Dexcom, which would introduce glucose monitoring on the Ionic Smartwatch. This somewhat nudges Fitbit beyond just fitness tracking into something that’s more in the vein of health tracking in general. Starting in 2018, the Fitbit Ionic will show users data from a Dexcom G5 mobile sensor. It’s a collaboration that’s aimed at developing and marketing products to better manage diabetes.
Fitbit is well known for its fitness trackers, but increasingly there’s been a proliferation of trackers that focus on all areas of health. The Apple Watch is trying to move further into something that’s broader than simply fitness, and there are startups like Proof looking to pick away little niches like tracking blood alcohol content. The sum of all these little niches may end up as a comprehensive health tracking device, though cramming them all into one piece of hardware may prove more challenging than initially expected.
It’s a nice jump and a reprieve from a pretty ho-hum month for Fitbit, which has seen a slight bump in its performance.

Still, any sign of life that alters the calculus of the kind of business Fitbit can build means there’s likely going to be a big stock price swing like we’re seeing today. Fitbit has barely sustained “unicorn” status, but it’s nowhere near where it was when it went public, and has had to fight to convince Wall Street that it’s a real, healthy company.",2017-09-07,1537477,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fitbit_ionic_3qtr_sport_adidas.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,dexcom,Fitbit is surging after it announced a big health partnership,"fitbit,apple-watch",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/fitbit-is-surging-after-it-announced-a-big-health-partnership/
Sarah Buhr,Gadgets,"Wearable fitness makers are increasingly interested in tracking our vitals. Now Fitbit has announced a collaboration with glucose monitor company Dexcom to develop and market products to help those with diabetes better manage the disease, starting with Fitbit’s Ionic Smartwatch.
Starting in 2018, the Fitbit Ionic will show users data from the Dexcom G5 Mobile sensor, which is worn just under the skin and can show vitals every 5 minutes. This means you will have to insert the $900 sensor first.
The Dexcom sensor is also supported by the Apple Watch, via a reroute through the iPhone but will soon be on the Watch itself through core Bluetooth, which is coming in watchOS4.
Tracking using Fitbit and Apple Watch is still rather difficult if you can’t afford Dexcom’s monitoring device. However, for those with the device already implanted it could prove useful. More than 422 million people around the world have diabetes, a fraction of whom are presumed to be using a wearable for tracking their blood glucose levels.
“The collaboration between Dexcom and Fitbit is an important step in providing useful information to people with diabetes that is both convenient and discreet,” said Dexcom CEO Kevin Saye in a statement. “We believe that providing Dexcom CGM data on Fitbit Ionic, and making that experience available to users of both Android and iOS devices, will have a positive impact on the way people manage their diabetes.”",2017-09-07,1537425,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-840186666.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"smartwatch,computing,wearable-devices",Fitbit is teaming up with Dexcom for glucose monitoring on the Ionic Smartwatch,fitbit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/fitbit-is-teaming-up-with-dexcom-for-glucose-monitoring-on-the-ionic-smartwatch/
Matt Burns,Gadgets,"Tome Software has teamed up with Trek Bicycle to reduce the number of bike to vehicle collisions. To achieve this goal, the partners have turned to using artificial intelligence at the autonomous vehicle testing facility, Mcity. The project will be conducted at Mcity’s TechLab, a partnership between the University of Michigan’s Center for Entrepreneurship and Mcity around mobility.
The project’s press release points to an US DOT study that found a combined 46,000 cyclists suffered from vehicle accidents and fatalities in 2015.
“Bicycle-to-vehicle collisions is a problem that affects all cyclists; a community we’re all passionate about,” said Jake Sigal, founder and CEO for Tome Software. “When Scott’s team at Trek approached me about helping to get automakers interested in working with the cycling community, I felt a personal responsibility to take part in leading this project. Tome’s cycling and vehicle integrations experience puts us in a unique position to develop solutions that will save cyclists’ lives.”
Sigal tells TechCrunch there are three aspects to the project. They will start by identifying the most dangerous zones on the road and then work out a solution to share this data with cyclists and then motorists. AI will be used for the first part.
Tome Software was founded by Sigal in 2014 after he sold his previous startup, Livio Radio, to Ford. The company focuses on developing connectivity solutions for larger companies. The company’s first product was integrated into a HumanScale desk that will tell the worker when to sit and stand.
For this bike project, Trek enlisted the help of Tome.
“Trek has a longstanding commitment to the development of solutions to enhance the safety of all cyclists,” said Eric Bjorling, brand manager for Trek. “Research and innovation have been at the heart of those efforts and having a partner like Tome to accelerate ensuring that a cyclist’s most basic needs are met is going to have a massive impact.”
Bicycling is experiencing a sort of renaissance and are quickly reaching new users through various means including bike sharing. As the DOT data shows, there’s a large area of opportunity to make biking safer.",2017-09-07,1537290,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/summer-sport-bikes-bicycles.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"cycling,trek,mcity",Tome Software and Trek Bicycle are looking to AI to make biking safer,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/tome-software-and-trek-bicycle-are-looking-to-ai-to-make-biking-safer/
Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"Apple is about to unveil a brand new iPhone on September 12. For the first time, the company is likely going to switch from LCD displays to OLED displays, a newer technology that is causing some challenges. In particular, according to a new report from KGI Securities and obtained by Apple Insider, Samsung is going to be the sole supplier. Samsung is taking advantage of that by charging a ton of money for those displays.
KGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple is paying $45 to $55 for LCD displays in current iPhone models. But Samsung is asking for $120 and $130 per unit. This could be the reason why the next high-end iPhone is going to be so expensive.
There are a few reasons why Apple has no choice but to pay a small fortune. First, Apple needs OLED displays more than ever before. Rumor has it that the next iPhone is going to feature a taller screen that is going to nearly fill the front of the device. Think of it as an iPhone 7-shaped device, but with a screen that expands toward the top and bottom edge of the device.
It’s like having an iPhone 7 Plus display in an iPhone 7 body. But the issue is that Apple will have to deal with a small-ish battery for quite a big display. Among other things, OLED displays are more energy-efficient. That’s why Apple can compensate the bigger display with OLED technology.
While many Android manufacturers have used OLED displays for years, Apple faces some interesting scaling issues. The company is currently selling over 200 million iPhones every year.
Shipping hundreds of millions of devices creates some incredible supply chain issues. Apple can’t adopt the latest and newest components if it can’t get hundreds of millions components every year. A single component shortage could create a bottleneck for the entire production. Designing the iPhone is already quite impressive, but being able to ship so many iPhones is even more impressive.
Right now, the only OLED supplier that can help Apple is Samsung. LG also manufactures OLED displays, but Bloomberg just reported that Apple will have to wait until 2019 to get LG displays. LG’s current OLED displays are also nowhere near as good as Samsung’s displays — just look at this Ars Technica comparison.
That’s how you end up with a classic case of asynchronous competition. Samsung and Apple are competing like crazy to sell more smartphones around the world. But Samsung is also an important supplier. Apple has to pay Samsung for those sweet, sweet OLED displays.",2017-09-07,1537266,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mkbhd-iphone-8-dummy-unit.png?w=738,gadgets/,"iphone-8,iphone",Samsung is making Apple pay a small fortune for the iPhone 8 display,"samsung,apple",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/samsung-is-making-apple-pay-a-small-fortune-for-the-iphone-8-display/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"If you’re someone with a horrible allergy that’s not often accommodated at restaurants or food producers, taking a bite means taking your life into your hands — or mouth, I suppose. A new device developed at Harvard Medical School may soon let you test food for common allergens instead of using yourself as your own guinea pig.
It’s called the integrated exogenous antigen testing system, or iEAT — I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. The researchers describe it in a paper published in the journal ACS Nano.
First you put a bit of food on the “antigen extraction device,” a single-use slide that does the necessary chemical deconstruction. You plug that into the iEAT device itself, which is small and light enough to fit on a keychain, and contains the electronics necessary to analyze the prepared food sample.
Within 10 minutes, it should tell you whether any given allergens are present, and if so, how much. That isn’t exactly lightning quick, but the alternatives are slower, bulkier or more dangerous (i.e. just eating it). And the iEAT actually detects even smaller amounts than lab tests. It’s not the only tester out there: There’s also the Nima, but that only does gluten and it’s a lot more expensive, and Ally, which did lactose in its prototype phase.
Right now the device is set up to detect peanuts, hazelnuts, wheat, milk and eggs, but it could easily be configured to find other things: shellfish, pesticides and so on. The researchers tested it on a few restaurant items themselves and found gluten in a “gluten-free” salad, and egg protein in beer (gross).
The whole thing supposedly costs $40, though of course the antigen extraction devices are where they get you — hopefully you’ll be able to buy in bulk. Whatever the case, it’s better than having your throat close up or developing some horrible rash.",2017-09-06,1537001,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/allergen-tester.jpg?w=720,gadgets/,"harvard,food-allergies",$40 keychain-size detector quickly alerts you of allergens in food,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/40-keychain-size-detector-quickly-alerts-you-of-allergens-in-food/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Security researchers in China have invented a clever way of activating voice recognition systems without speaking a word. By using high frequencies inaudible to humans but which register on electronic microphones, they were able to issue commands to every major “intelligent assistant” that were silent to every listener but the target device.
The team from Zhejiang University calls their technique DolphinAttack (PDF), after the animals’ high-pitched communications. In order to understand how it works, let’s just have a quick physics lesson.
Microphones like those in most electronics use a tiny, thin membrane that vibrates in response to air pressure changes caused by sound waves. Since people generally can’t hear anything above 20 kilohertz, the microphone software generally discards any signal above that frequency, although technically it is still being detected — it’s called a low-pass filter.
A perfect microphone would vibrate at a known frequency at, and only at, certain input frequencies. But in the real world, the membrane is subject to harmonics — for example, a tone at 400 Hz will also elicit a response at 200 Hz and 800 Hz (I’m fudging the math here but this is the general idea. There are some great gifs illustrating this at Wikipedia). This usually isn’t an issue, however, since harmonics are much weaker than the original vibration.
But say you wanted a microphone to register a tone at 100 Hz but for some reason didn’t want to emit that tone. If you generated a tone at 800 Hz that was powerful enough, it would create that 100 Hz tone with its harmonics, only on the microphone. Everyone else would just hear the original 800 Hz tone and would have no idea that the device had registered anything else.
That’s basically what the researchers did, although in a much more exact fashion, of course. They determined that yes, in fact, most microphones used in voice-activated devices, from phones to smart watches to home hubs, are subject to this harmonic effect.
First they tested it by creating a target tone with a much higher ultrasonic frequency. That worked, so they tried recreating snippets of voice with layered tones between 500 and 1,000 Hz — a more complicated process, but not fundamentally different. And there’s not a lot of specialized hardware needed — off the shell stuff at Fry’s or its Chinese equivalent.
The demodulated speech registered just fine, and worked on every major voice recognition platform:
They were able to execute a number of commands, from wake phrases (“OK Google”) to multi-word requests (“unlock the back door”). Different phones and phrases had different success rates, naturally, or worked better at different distances. None worked farther than 5 feet away, though.
It’s a scary thought — that invisible commands could be humming through the air and causing your device to execute them (of course, one could say the same of Wi-Fi). But the danger is limited for several reasons.
First, you can defeat DolphinAttack simply by turning off wake phrases. That way you’d have to have already opened the voice recognition interface for the attack to work.
Second, even if you keep the wake phrase on, many devices restrict functions like accessing contacts, apps and websites until you have unlocked them. An attacker could ask about the weather or find nearby Thai places, but it couldn’t send you to a malicious website.
Third, and perhaps most obviously, in its current state the attack has to take place within a couple of feet and against a phone in the open. Even if they could get close enough to issue a command, chances are you’d notice right away if your phone woke up and said, “OK, wiring money to Moscow.”
That said, there are still places where this could be effective. A compromised IoT device with a speaker that can generate ultrasound might be able to speak to a nearby Echo and tell it to unlock a door or turn off an alarm.
This threat may not be particularly realistic, but it illustrates the many avenues by which attackers can attempt to compromise our devices. Getting them out in the open now and devising countermeasures are an essential part of the vetting process for any technology that aspires to being in everyday use.",2017-09-06,1536878,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/speech-recognition.png?w=738,gadgets/,"voice-recognition,alexa,ultrasound",Hackers send silent commands to speech recognition systems with ultrasound,siri,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/hackers-send-silent-commands-to-speech-recognition-systems-with-ultrasound/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Mars is a long way away, and super expensive to get to, so if you have the very specific dream of owning your own Mars rover, it’s probably not going to happen. But if you want an EARTH rover, there’s a new Kickstarter project that could deliver one once it reaches its funding goal. The Turtle Rover is a new robot built by a small team that has worked on a number of Mars rover prototype projects for the European, German and Swedish space agencies.
The five-person team is seeking €60,000 (roughly $71,500 U.S.) to get their rover ON the ground (that’s a great joke), and will look to ship the vehicle beginning in April of next year, with DIY kits and fully built machines available to backers starting at around the $1,000 mark.

Turtle is a four-wheel ground drone that can drive for up to four hours on a single charge of its included battery, with control facilitated via an app that’s compatible with most computers, tablets and smartphones. The Turtle can create its own Wi-Fi network for connections when you’re off the grid, which is great, because this thing is designed for exploring off the beaten path.
It’s based on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer, running Raspbian, and it comes equipped with a full HD camera for video capture and live streaming. The design is watertight, which means, according to the project’s creators, that it can be fully submerged in water with no ill effects. There’s also a robot arm provided with the roader, which can lift up to 1.1 pounds. And it’s fully customizable, so you can incorporate your own add-ons, like the Microsoft Kinect or a LiDAR sensor for depth and environment sensing.
It can carry up to 11 pounds on its back, in fact, so you could easily load up a DSLR and lens, or a box to load down with your cache of interesting geological samples if you’re doing some remote spelunking. All of the hardware and software is also fully open source, and the project’s creators encourage its use as a development or educational platform.
The Turtle Rover is designed to reach hard-to-access places more easily than you could, and to do so without intruding as much as a lumbering human. You can see in the video how it might be able to explore where you can’t. The team says it also has a very low center of gravity, and a suspension inspired by actual NASA Mars rovers, which should help it navigate even tricky terrain with aplomb — and without rolling over.
Turtle Rover was created by its five-person team, which includes Simon Dzwonczyk, Julia Marek, Martin Twardak, Aleksander Dziopa and Justyna Pelc, with no external funding, and is relying 100 percent on backers at this point. Despite that, the five left their corporate jobs and managed to build a fully functional prototype in six months, and they say that now venture capitalists are calling since they’ve demonstrated their ability to make Turtle a real thing.
For a bootstrapped hardware startup project it looks very promising, and like something that would appeal to any amateur space or drone hobbyists looking to dig deeper into their interest, or help educate others with a true maker project. The Kickstarter campaign ends on September 24, and is about halfway to its goal as of this writing.",2017-09-06,1536879,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/turtle-rover.gif?w=640,gadgets/,,You can get your own mini Mars rover for Earth through this new project,kickstarter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/you-can-get-your-own-mini-mars-rover-for-earth-through-this-new-project/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"One of the primary benefits of using Slack is the ability to communicate and share information across a company, but as usage scales it can sometimes lead to information overload and an inability to keep work organized. Pingpad released an update today to bring an organizational layer to Slack that could help teams keep their project information more orderly inside the communications tool.
“Most companies we work with spend 80 percent of their time in Slack, but the conversational UI is a blessing and a curse,” Pingpad CEO and co-founder Ross Mayfield told TechCrunch. “Slack is great at communication, but it doesn’t support collaboration and coordination. We help you get Slack organized,” he explained.
The update includes a new concept called Pingpad boards, which offers a Trello-like experience for organizing projects by content type such as open items, completed tasks and shared documents. Each of these items is more than a simple to-do task. They are each full-fledged documents unto themselves. Clicking any item on the board opens an editor for adding content.
While the board is separate from Slack, the work on the board is fully integrated in Slack via Pingpad Conversations.
“Today we have Pingpad Conversations that let you have a focused conversation on a task, a decision or content you are creating, which are synced across Slack or in the PIngpad Web App,” Mayfield explained.
That means if you share a note created in Slack, the Pingpad bot recognizes it as a note and allows you to see more information about it, while teeing up next actions such as providing feedback about the content or even closing the item when it’s completed. All changes get synced across Slack and Pingpad automatically.
Pingpad was first released last year as a stand-alone Wiki for use with Slack. You could create documents in Pingpad and share them inside Slack, but not much more. The update provides, not only the ability to create and share underlying project documents created in Pingpad, but also additional conversational structure for projects within Slack through on-going automated integration with Pingpad and the ability to collaborate with colleagues and move projects forward.
Not surprisingly, Mayfield doesn’t see this as additional set of activities, so much as a helper tool to make Slack users more productive. “What we are doing is helping things get done in the flow of the regular work where they are doing their work now,” he said.",2017-09-12,1539218,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/30298285936_0dae10d50f_k.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"communication,collaboration,pingpad",Pingpad update brings organizational layer to Slack,slack,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/pingpad-update-brings-organizational-layer-to-slack/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"When Alteryx acquired Yhat in June, it was only a matter of time before the startup’s data-science management software began showing up in Alteryx. Just today, the company announced Alteryx Promote, a new tool based on Yhat’s product set.
The company made the announcement at the Alteryx Inspire Europe customer event taking place in London this week.
Alteryx Promote gives data scientists using the Alteryx platform a tool to build models and share them much more quickly than they have been able to in the past because of a lack of tools. Using the assets from Yhat, customers can now build, test and deploy models much more quickly, Dean Stoecker, Alteryx CEO and co-founder explained.
 
By now, just about every company has plenty of data to work with, and they may even have data scientists working with the data, but what they have been lacking is a tool to build and share models and put them to work in the rest of the company. Alteryx Promote is designed to get the data to the various constituencies in the company who need it.
Yhat came out of Y Combinator in 2015. The company’s founders wanted to solve a common problem in data science circles — trying to get the various parties involved in building data applications to communicate with one another and build applications faster. (Dataiku is another startup trying to solve this.) The first product the company produced was called ScienceOps, which was the tool that would become Promote.
Alteryx, which went public earlier this year, is looking to become the soup-to-nuts analytics platform for data scientists and business analysts, and having a tool that allowed the different parties to share data was a missing piece before the Yhat purchase.
The Promote product was announced today, but won’t be generally available until Q1 next year. Unfortunately Yhat, the colorful name derived from a German statistical measurement, looks like it will be deprecated moving forward, but the technology lives on.",2017-09-12,1538755,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-837882556.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"analytics,big-data,yhat,alteryx",Alteryx Promote puts data science to work across the company,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/alteryx-promote-puts-data-science-to-work-across-the-company/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Rackspace today announced its intention to acquire Datapipe, one of its largest competitors in the managed public and private cloud services business. Rackspace expects the acquisition, which is its largest one yet, to close in the next quarter.
The two privately held companies did not disclose the financial details of the transaction, but Datapipe has raised more than $310 million in equity funding since its launch in 1998 and this deal surely didn’t come cheap. Datapipe’s majority owner, Abry Partners, will become an equity investor in Rackspace and the combined company will have more than 6,700 employees and do more than $2.4 billion in annual revenue.
“The reason we’re buying them is that we want to extend our leadership in multi-cloud services,” Rackspace chief strategy officer Matt Bradley told me. “It’s a sign and signal that we’re going for it.” Bradley expects that the combined company will make Rackspace the largest private cloud player and the largest managed hosting service. He also noted that the fact that Rackspace is now a private company again, with a single owner, allowed it to go for this deal. “This would have been very hard to get done under our old structure,” he noted.
While Datapipe has been extremely successful in the enterprise and with government customers, Rackspace has traditionally focused more on the mid-market segment. Indeed, Bradley argues that the two companies didn’t typically compete on every deal and he stressed that even their product portfolios are quite different, too. He added that while Rackspace could have gained similar technical capabilities by making a number of smaller acquisitions, that process would have taken much longer and wouldn’t necessarily have given Rackspace access to the kind of customers that Datapipe currently works with, and Bradley argues that would’ve taken at least two years — if not longer.

Those customers include a large number of large public-sector companies, but also the U.S. departments of defense, energy and justice, in addition to the U.K.’s cabinet office, ministry of justice and department of transportation.
Once the acquisition closes, Rackspace will also get new data centers and offices in markets where it currently doesn’t have much of a presence, including the West Coast (something its customers have long asked for), Brazil, China and Russia. In China, Datapipe also currently offers managed services on the fast-growing Alibaba Cloud and that’s surely a market Rackspace wants to play in, too. Rackspace will also get access to Datapipe’s colocation services — a market it hasn’t traditionally played in — and the company’s professional services businesses.
Bradley noted that Rackspace can also bring new capabilities to current Datapipe users, including its services for Azure Stack and VMware Cloud on AWS, as well as its managed services on the Google Cloud Platform.
Because the two companies still have to wait for regulatory approval, some of the details of what the combined company will look like remain unclear. The official word is that “Rackspace will develop a comprehensive integration plan and will take great care to maintain and
enhance the exceptional customer outcomes that both companies are known for.” Rackspace also notes that its executive team will stay in place and might expand after the acquisition closes.",2017-09-11,1538612,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-133273359.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"enterprise,datapipe,rackspace",Rackspace acquires Datapipe as it looks to expand its managed services business,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/rackspace-acquires-datapipe-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-managed-cloud-business/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Data Artisans, the business arm of open source tool, Apache Flink, announced an early-access release of the commercial version of their platform today that includes a new tool for managing streaming applications.
Kostas Tzoumas, CEO at Data Artisans, says managing applications on a real-time streaming product presents some serious challenges for customers, and the new Application Manager is designed to solve this.
While their larger Flink users like Netflix, Alibaba or ING have the resources and skill to build such a tool to manage and monitor high-volume streaming activity themselves, the average enterprise doesn’t have that luxury, Tzoumas said.
These customers often build applications that have to interact with a number of external systems, all while trying to process high volumes of data in near real time. The company created the management piece to reduce the complexity associated with this process, Tzoumas explained.
The new tool provides a central management console for all of the streaming activity running through Flink including the ability to view streaming data sources, developer workflows, service deployment architecture and logging and metrics tools.
Beyond managing all of the underlying services that interact with the Apache Flink streaming applications, it also allows developers to manage the applications development process, then launch their applications using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes.
What’s more, it keeps an audit trail of all user actions related to the Apache Flink stream should a team need to retrace its steps after deployment.
The company founders, Tzoumas and CTO Stephen Ewen, built Apache Flink while still in college, then went onto found Data Artisans in 2014 as the commercial arm of the company. They began with a standard open source business model, helping customers support Apache Flink and also acting as consultants to help companies build and launch their own Apache Flink streaming applications. But as they worked with customers, they saw the missing management tool as another commercial opportunity.
The company is based in Berlin and has raised nearly $7 million. Users download Apache Flink 10,000 times a month. The new commercial version should be generally available toward the end of 2017 or the beginning of 2018.",2017-09-11,1538568,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-545863969.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"open-source,apache-flink",Data Artisans announces commercial Application Manager for open source Apache Flink,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/data-artisans-announces-commercial-applications-manager-for-open-source-apache-flink/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"Filling out forms online and on mobile can be a tedious and bug-ridden — yet annoyingly necessary — experience. Today, a startup called Typeform has raised a significant round of capital to help fund its mission to change all that, with a platform that the startup claims gets its customers much better results because the interactive experiences created on it are more intuitive and thus easier to engage with.
The startup, based out of Barcelona, today announced a Series B of $35 million led by General Atlantic as it drives deeper into international markets, specifically the US; and expands its tools for developers with more analytics and artificial intelligence features to personalise the experience more. Along with the funding and in keeping with this platform focus, the company today is also announcing a new portal for developers.
“We are proud to be the first company to transform the online data collection space by creating conversational forms. But now we’d like to take things further,” said Robert Muñoz, co-CEO and cofounder of Typeform, in a statement. He believes that Typeform is playing a role in “bridging the gap between data collection and customer interaction.”
This round also included participation from Index Ventures, Point Nine, and Connect Ventures, all previous backers.
In total, Typeform has now raised just over $52 million. The valuation with this round is not being disclosed but in its last funding of around $15 million two years ago, Typeform was worth $70 million post-money, David Okuniev, Typeform’s other cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. He added that this latest funding was an “up-round” and its valuation has grown. (I’m asking around to see if I can get a more current number and will update when and if I learn more.)
He said the company is ‘almost’ profitable.
Other notable investors in Typeform include Anthony Casalena, CEO of Squarespace; Javier Olivan, VP of growth at Facebook; and Jay Parikh, Facebook’s VP of engineering.
It sometimes happens that the most successful startups are founded in response to an enterpreneur’s frustration with an existing product or service. And so it was the case with Typeform. Co-founders Muñoz and David Okuniev are both designers — specifically with focuses on interaction, UX, and UI — and were running their own agencies back in 2011, when they found themselves working jointly on a single brief (for a toilet company of all things).
When the client asked for a new form to help pick up new business leads and more customer data, the pair were unable to find any suitable online templates or platforms that would not only get users to fill out their information with reliable regularity (no pun intended to the toilet company) but provide details that could be used for sales in the future.
“We felt there was a lack of attention given to engaging users in the first place,” Okuniev said, who added that the interaction that had been invented for forms hadn’t changed since the 1990s. 
The two set out to build something themselves, and then used that as the basis of what became Typeform, first launched in 2012, a more dynamic form-creating interface that presented questions one at a time. “We wanted to address that in a serious way, but you could also say it was accidental,” Okuniev said. “We had no intention of building a startup out of this.”
Today, creating basic online forms is nearly a commoditised business, with companies like Google offering products like Forms free of charge, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter letting people create free polls and other services, and so on.
Unsurprisingly, Typeform has been iterating on its original product over the years, and today concentrates more on APIs and other developer tools, which are offered in a freemium model based on usage and additional features.
At the same time, the startup has very much pushed into making its service something that one can use in any scenario where a user might need to enter data: from basic information entry like job application and contact forms; through to surveys; registration forms; shopping and order forms; online learning and tests; and invitations.
The flexibility of the platform, and the focus on making more dynamic interactive experiences, translates into results. Okuniev said that the average conversion rate on one of Typeform’s forms — whether it’s a questionnaire, customer service request, quiz, poll, order form, or something else — is 57 percent, compared to a conversion rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent for more conventional forms. 
Its success is also playing out in user numbers. Today, Okuniev said that the company has 30,000 paying customers, and “a lot more” than this using its free tier. Customers include both small and medium sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies in the tech, retail, and hospitality industries.
Typeform’s today describes its form-filling platform as “conversational”, but its original concept behind that pre-dates a lot of the talk we hear today about conversational AI, and bots.
On the other hand, Typeform’s ethos is also very contemporary: it focuses on presenting and asking for information using conversational language, and works on the basis of feeding questions one at a time and getting answers in return and tailoring subsequent questions based on those responses.
That being said, today, the startup does not use any AI in its platform, although it’s being considered, either by growing it in-house (today the company has around 170 employees, including engineers), or by partnering with an existing firm, or potentially through an acquisition.
“AI is definitely on our minds,” Okuniev said. “We are doing some projects internally around user behaviour around form entry and we will be integrating that into the product soon. We want to help our customers generate more conversations, and we think our products could help with that.”
The focus on creating an interactive platform based around natural language is one reason why investors were interested in helping fund the startup to grow.
“Digital forms are transitioning from a simple data-collection tool into an integral part of the customer engagement journey,” said Chris Caulkin of General Atlantic, in a statement.
So, too, is the platform flexibility. “If you think about the proliferation of device types and browsers, including forms and data collection can be a real pain point,” Caulkin said in an interview. “And the solution that Typeform has developed can be easily integrated and managed by the product, not the tech, team.”
Caulkin is joining Typeform’s board with this round.
The interactivity and square focus on sales and customer relationships also makes the company a prime target for acquisition, in my opinion, with companies such as Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Microsoft/LinkedIn and many others all looking at better ways to help businesses interface with users, particularly across platforms with more tricky interfaces, like mobile. In the meantime, Typeform is also working on integrating more with other, existing platforms, such as Mail Chimp.",2017-09-11,1538674,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/7.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"crm,forms,general-atlantic,typeform","Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/
John Biggs,Enterprise,"At this point in the game there should be a single page on every corporate website, preferably accessible from its front page, that includes the name and all contact details for the Chief Security Officer, including the last four digits of her social security number. It should be her responsibility to ensure that no one uses this information for nefarious purposes in addition to her daily operations. This honeypot should inspire the this CSO to go to great lengths to protect herself and her company’s data.
It’s only fair, right?
This person – who in Equifax’s case was named John Kelley III and earned nearly $3 million for releasing 143 million customer records (about 2 cents per record) – should also be the first to be fired during a breach. Further, this person should no longer work in “security” and instead be relegated where he can do less damage, perhaps in food service but not food preparation.

I doubt they’d be trustworthy enough to fry a hamburger.
I know it’s a little Hunger Games but I think that’s where we are in 2017. Corporate security is an afterthought.
I propose this for a simple reason: no one else on Equifax’s corporate leadership board works on security. There are plenty of folks dedicate to sales and revenue growth but only Kelley has “has responsibility for legal services, global sourcing, security and compliance, government and legislative relations and more.” He’s a lawyer.
Breaches are an affront to decades of innovation and research. Breaches are an affront to ethics, customer support, and trust. Breaches are an affront to shareholders and those who depended on Equifax for, arguably, a ridiculous service in these days of trust-less networks and powerful data mining tools.
Add in a clearly inept team at,  we assume, Edelman, and you have a perfect storm of corporate idiocy. Look at this:
Yesterday I tried Equifax’s “security checker”/Wordpress instance yesterday, September 8. It said:

Apparently, however, you could type in Booger/123456 and get the same answer. Now, thanks to what we can assume was some interference by Equifax’s legal department, nobody is affected, not even Booger.

That’s right: it went from “Yeah, you’re definitely probably hacked” to “No, you’re probably not hacked” overnight. This tool should be burnt down.
In short, Equifax can’t protect your data, can’t build a website, and can’t get its story straight. And this is a publicly-traded company with a century of tradition and trust behind it.
Why am I so angry at this? Imagine John Kelley III had a box of family photos. He sent those family photos to a service for digitization. Those photos included tender moments, pictures loved ones dead and gone, and snaps joyous occasions. There’s ap picture there of him passing the bar, of getting married, of saying goodbye to his father. This photo digitization service did the job – poorly, to be clear, because we’re equating it to Equifax – and then threw the box of photos with full identifying information onto the street. John Kelley’s grandmother’s photo was used to create a fake ID. John Kelley’s birthday party pic was posted to Facebook and someone figured out his birthdate or some other piece of trivial information and opened a credit card in his name. Trolls found a picture of his car, deduced its location, and cut the brake lines. The list of offenses can go on ad nauseam.
Now imagine the same thing is happening to you. Almost monthly your family photos, your birth certificate, and your diary are being ransacked or nearly ransacked by criminals. Your valuables are being broadcast to those who would like to steal them. Imagine that the companies you trust with your health, wealth, and privacy are leaking your information almost daily and that the tools used to secure that data are infuriatingly easy to crack as possible. You’d be mad as hell and you wouldn’t take it anymore.
But you aren’t. And you do.
Until John Kelley III is held accountable, until everyone who leaks our data and uses weak tools and methods to secure our data is out of a job, we will not be safe. Sure, many of us have little to hide but it is our right to nonetheless hide what little we do have. Corporate security talks a big game but fails every time. That has to change.",2017-09-09,1538351,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/2e5a8e87971c4d4abe60ff4de74c79cb.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"cyberwarfare,cryptography,computer-security,security",A perfect storm of corporate idiocy,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/a-perfect-storm-of-corporate-idiocy/
Matthew Lynley,Earnings,"Cloudera said today as part of its second-quarter earnings report that it is acquiring Fast Forward Labs, a startup that gives companies the latest information on how to apply machine learning and AI to their businesses, as well as consulting.
The company’s stock has weathered somewhat of a beating since it went public, though it was able to beat Wall Street’s expectations today. But the more interesting news is the acquisition of Fast Forward Labs, a company that specializes in consulting with larger enterprises about emerging trends in machine learning that can help their businesses grow. Cloudera specializes in operating on top of open-source technology, looking to deliver an enterprise-grade product for larger organizations.
“On the way, we built a profitable company with real impact on our clients’ products and businesses. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished,” CEO and co-founder Hilary Mason said in a post announcing the acquisition. “However, we’re just getting started. The enterprise is more excited about machine learning and applied artificial intelligence than ever, and in order to meet this growing opportunity, we are heading in a new direction.”
Collecting that kind of expertise is going to be critical as it looks to woo enterprises into paying for additional support and services on top of open-source software. Cloudera’s business can be a tricky one, much like Docker and MongoDB — which is built on top of open-source technology that anyone can use. Cloudera has to show companies that it can build a better product than they might be able to deploy themselves, or simply make it much easier to deploy by paying the company so it’s another thing those companies don’t have to worry about.
The company said it brought in revenue of $89.8 million and a loss of 17 cents per share, while Wall Street was looking for a loss of 25 cents per share on revenue of $85.5 million. Here’s the stock chart for the past few months since it went public:

Cloudera was one of a big batch of companies that went public in the early part of the year after Snap opened up the so-called IPO window. Since then, a significant portion of those companies have had some issues — with Blue Apron and Snap seeing massive declines in their shares. Cloudera is still an enterprise company, but after seeing a 20 percent spike on day one has fallen back to Earth.
Still, there appears to be an opportunity for businesses here, as Cloudera was able to deliver a positive earnings report and database software startup MongoDB has confidentially filed to go public.",2017-09-07,1537629,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/23237367885_2d272c0428_o.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"hilary-mason,mongodb,cloudera",Cloudera acquires AI research firm Fast Forward Labs,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/cloudera-acquires-ai-research-startup-fast-forward-labs/
John Mannes,Earnings,"Okta kept its beat-streak alive today with a healthy earnings report. On the back of international growth and a healthy services business, Okta beat revenue expectations by nine percent and managed to handily top EPS expectations.
Analysts had been expecting about $55.9 million in revenue with a loss of $0.26 per share. Instead, Okta reported $61 million in revenue with $0.16 loss per share.
Okta’s six offerings support businesses’ efforts to secure the “extended enterprise.” This is corporate-speak for managing contractors and other suppliers who need to access enterprise services but might be using their personal, unsecured devices.
Company CEO Todd McKinnon specifically drew attention to improving operating margin within the earnings report itself. The company has been working hard to ensure thoughtful growth while scaling its sales and marketing operations.
“We are not a grow-at-all-costs company,” Frederic Kerrest, COO of Okta, explained to me in an interview. “We don’t have that mentality.”
As this process moves forward, Kerrest says he is paying attention to net retention rates, the number of customers paying over $100,000 per year and international growth rates. International growth currently represents approximately 15 percent of Okta’s total revenue. Revenue overall has grown 63 percent year-over-year while international revenue is growing at about 100 percent YoY.
General and administrative operating expenses have increased substantively over the last year as Okta, like every public company, builds up compliance infrastructure to adhere to Sarbanes-Oxley. Otherwise, sales and marketing expenses are increasing as one would expect of a rapidly scaling company.
Kerrest hopes to continue to de-emphasize Okta’s services businesses, its other revenue driver outside subscriptions. The company is building up partnerships with consulting firms like Accenture to offload enterprise integration work.
In general, things are looking good for Okta. From April to July, Okta’s share price wobbled up and down between $22 and $26 per share. But since the start of August, Okta has been on a tear. The company’s share price pushed upwards from $22.37 on July 28 to nearly $28 this week. And Okta’s second earnings report alone drove its share price up five percent to $28.50 in the initial moments after it was released.",2017-09-07,1537499,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/okta_160328_439.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"accenture,revenue,okta",Okta has a great earnings day on the back of strong international growth,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/okta-has-a-great-earnings-day-on-the-back-of-strong-international-growth/
Frederic Lardinois,Enterprise,"Almost exactly a year ago, Microsoft and Adobe announced a strategic partnership around Microsoft’s Azure cloud and Adobe’s Marketing Cloud. That, however, was only a first step for the two companies. Today, they are announcing a major expansion of this partnership that sees them collaborating around e-signatures and team communications.
Specifically, this expanded deal means that Adobe Sign will become Microsoft’s preferred e-signature solution, with integrations into Office 365 and Dynamics 365, while Microsoft Teams — the company’s Slack competitor — will become the preferred collaboration service for the Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud.
Microsoft will also integrate Adobe Sign into services like its workflow automation service Flow, and the Microsoft bot framework will be able to talk to Sign, too, to check on the status of an approval process, for example. And when a user drops a new template into a specific Creative Cloud folder, Flow will also be able to see this and automatically route the document through the approval process.
Similarly, Adobe will also make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud of Adobe sign. This means Adobe’s Creative Cloud tools, for example, will see deep integrations into Microsoft Teams.

The Adobe Sign integration with Teams, Flow, Word, PowerPoint and Outlook will go live in the coming weeks. The Creative Cloud integration with Microsoft teams will also launch soon, with the integrations into the Adobe Experience Cloud following after that.
Adobe’s Jon Perera, the company’s VP of product development for its Document Cloud, told me that he expects this deal will also make other Adobe products, including the likes of the Adobe Stock stock imagery marketplace, more discoverable, and will hence drive more users to it. The two companies also expect to do a lot of joint enterprise customer engagements and campaigns.
Microsoft and Adobe obviously share a huge number of customers already, while their product portfolio only overlaps in a few areas. That makes for an easy partnership, though it comes as a bit of a surprise that Microsoft wouldn’t want to build its own e-signature solution. I asked Microsoft’s corporate VP for Office 365 about this. “As a company, we always wanted a very strong partner ecosystem. We can’t do it all,” he told me. “What’s best for our company is to have a strong partner ecosystem. We do what each does best.”

Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Reddit revealed today that it has teamed with Lucidworks to provide a long-needed, modern search tool for the immensely popular online discussion platform.
When you face the kind of scale that Reddit does with over 300 million monthly active users generating 5 million comments and a staggering 40 million searches every day across a more than a million communities, it’s a daunting task to find a search tool to handle that kind of volume.
The challenge with Reddit extends beyond indexing these massive numbers. They also have to deal with wide variety of content with text, gifs, images and video by the score. While part of the goal was to improve traditional search functionality and deliver more relevant results, perhaps even more critically, they wanted a tool to help users surface the subjects that interest them without having to explicitly state it in the search box, Nick Caldwell, VP of engineering at Reddit explained.
“I think that people who come to any site, and Reddit in particular, prefer an experience where they don’t have to do manual keyword entry, but want a continuous stream of interesting content,” he said.
Reddit’s search engine had actually been notoriously bad and Caldwell made upgrading it a priority. “One of the things I wanted to do when I started at Reddit, was I wanted to fix [search]. People have been complaining about it for five years,” he said.
Part of the issue up to that point wasn’t a lack of desire to improve the search experience. Everyone understood the issue, but finding the time to update it was another matter. When Caldwell came on board, Reddit had a small team of 40 engineers, whose primary job was keeping a site of this size and scope up and running.
Caldwell said that the company went with the Lucidworks Fusion platform because it had the right combination of technology and the ability to augment his engineering team, while helping search to continually evolve on Reddit. Buying a tool was only part of the solution though. Reddit also needed to hire a group of engineers with what Caldwell called “world class search and relevance engineering expertise.” To that end, he has set up a 30-person engineering search team devoted to maximizing the potential of the new search platform.
Lucidworks is built on the open source search tool, Apache Solr, but company CEO Will Hayes says the commercial product has been built to scale to Reddit-like proportions. “Solr is the core engine. We still heavily contribute to the open source project, but we put a lot of focus on how people consume data,” Hayes explained.
The means working in a streaming fashion to span billions of records in near real time, while using analytics and machine learning to understand the underlying data and deliver more relevant results and content to Reddit users.
Today’s search update is part of Reddit’s wider campaign to update the site’s look and feel, which became an organizational priority after the site’s two founders returned to the company — with Alexis Ohanian coming back in 2014 and Steve Huffman in 2015.
“With Steve and Alexis coming back, they brought to table that the site should be more welcoming and engaging than it has been in the past. It took the leadership of Steve and Alexis to see that the content we have is really a gold mine, and we have to find a way to present it to users to unlock that potential,” he said.
While Lucidworks remains an active partner in the project, Caldwell hopes his team will be able to take over by the end of the year. He says the ultimate goal is a tool that is not only more relevant, but looks better and is more engaging.",2017-09-07,1537088,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-472334136.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"online-discussion,search,lucidworks",Reddit teams with Lucidworks to build new search framework,reddit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/reddit-builds-brand-new-search-framework-with-lucidworks/
Ron Miller,Artificial Intelligence,"IBM and MIT came together today to sign a 10-year, $240 million partnership agreement that establishes the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab at the prestigious Cambridge, MA academic institution.
The lab will be co-chaired by Dario Gil, IBM Research VP of AI and Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering.
Big Blue intends to invest $240 million into the lab where IBM researchers and MIT students and faculty will work side by side to conduct advanced AI research. As to what happens to the IP that the partnership produces, the sides were a bit murky about that.
This much we know: MIT plans to publish papers related to the research, while the two parties plan to open source a good part of the code. Some of the IP will end up inside IBM products and services. MIT hopes to generate some AI-based startups as part of the deal too.
“The core mission of joint lab is to bring together MIT scientists and IBM [researchers] to shape the future of AI and push the frontiers of science,” IBM’s Gil told TechCrunch.
To that end, the two parties plan to put out requests to IBM scientists and the MIT student community to submit ideas for joint research. To narrow the focus of what could be a broad endeavor, they have established a number of principles to guide the research.
This includes developing AI algorithms with goal of getting beyond specific applications for neural-based deep learning networks and finding more generalized ways to solve complex problems in the enterprise.
Secondly, they hope to harness the power of machine learning with quantum computing, an area that IBM is working hard to develop right now. There is tremendous potential for AI to drive the development of quantum computing and conversely for quantum computing and the computing power it brings to drive the development of AI.
With IBM’s Watson Security and Healthcare divisions located right down the street from MIT in Kendall Square, the two parties have agreed to concentrate on these two industry verticals in their work. Finally, the two teams plan to work together to help understand the social and economic impact of AI in society, which as we have seen has already proven to be considerable.
While this is a big deal for both MIT and IBM, Chandrakasan made clear that the lab is but one piece of a broader campus-wide AI initiative. Still, the two sides hope the new partnership will eventually yield a number of research and commercial breakthroughs that will lead to new businesses both inside IBM and in the Massachusetts startup community, particularly in the healthcare and cybersecurity areas.",2017-09-06,1536861,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-587966450-ibm-mit.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"partnerships,ibm-watson,mit,ibm","IBM and MIT pen 10-year, $240M AI research partnership",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/ibm-and-mit-pen-10-year-240m-ai-research-partnership/
Frederic Lardinois,Enterprise,"There can be no doubt that Kubernetes is where it’s at for container orchestration services these days. Mesosphere, which was one of the early companies to adopt containers and which focuses on allowing businesses to run their big data and analytics workloads in the cloud, today announced that it now also supports Kubernetes on its DC/OS platform for running big data applications in the cloud. This announcement is going to come as quite a surprise to many, given that Mesosphere has long offered its own container orchestration tool for DC/OS and Apache Mesos in the form of Marathon.
Kubernetes will be available in beta as part of the DC/OS 1.10 release that’s scheduled to launch on September 11.
The Information, which broke this story earlier this morning, argues that this means that Mesosphere is “bowing” to Kubernetes. That’s something Mesosphere co-founder and CEO Florian Leibert and Mesosphere CMO Peter Guagenti strongly denied when I talked to them earlier today. They both stressed that the idea here is to give Mesosphere’s users — which tend to be large enterprises — more choice. “Our customers tend to be infrastructure and operations professionals at large companies who are serving hundreds or thousands of developers in an organization,” Guagenti said. “For them, the most important thing they provide is freedom of choice.”
In Leibert’s view, offering support for Kubernetes as an orchestration engine is no different from offering support for multiple data services, continuous integration platforms and networking tools. Guagenti also later stressed that it’s important to remember that for Mesosphere’s customers, the platform isn’t about containers — it’s about deploying and managing data-intensive applications.
Leibert also noted that Marathon and Kubernetes have different use cases because Marathon can also be used to run legacy applications without container technology, while Kubernetes is obviously solely focused on containers. “So it’s natural for us to support both,” Leibert said. “A lot of these technologies are really like a layer cake. Kubernetes and Mesos can work really well together. Kubernetes takes over the container workflow but it can’t handle workflows that typically don’t run on containers like Hadoop.”
Guagenti also noted that he believes that Mesosphere is currently a leader in the container space, both in terms of the number of containers its users run in production and in terms of revenue (though the company sadly didn’t share any numbers).
Leibert and Guagenti both stressed that Mesosphere will continue to invest in Marathon, just like it always has.
Going forward, developers will be able to use DC/OS to set up and manage their Kubernetes-based container deployments (including different versions of Kubernetes) right from DC/OS and on the same infrastructure that runs the rest of their container deployments. Mesosphere worked with Google on this project and Mesosphere will offer its users a pure up-stream version of Kubernetes without any vendor-specific changes to ensure there are no compatibility issues.
“In bringing Kubernetes to DC/OS, Mesosphere provides customers with a robust platform for building, deploying, and operating data-rich, containerized applications in your data center and on public clouds,” said Allan Naim, a Google product manager in charge of Kubernetes and the Google Container Engine. “With projects like Kubernetes for containers and TensorFlow for machine intelligence running on both our platforms, Mesosphere DC/OS and Google Cloud Platform together offer a compelling open hybrid cloud platform. We’re excited to continue to work with Mesosphere and the community going forward.”
At the end of the day, Mesosphere argues that it’s simply giving its customers more choice, though it’s also clear that this is yet another win for the Kubernetes ecosystem, which really isn’t so much of a threat to Mesosphere, which has long found its own niche, but more for Docker, which runs the risk of falling behind, even as it kickstarted the container movement. Indeed, I can’t help but think that this move by Mesosphere is actually going to make it harder for Docker to find its own niche going forward.",2017-09-06,1536743,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/2017-09-06_1003.png?w=738,enterprise/,"enterprise,kubernetes,containers,mesosphere",Mesosphere adds Kubernetes support to its data center operating system,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/mesosphere-says-its-not-bowing-to-kubernetes/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Nginx, in its commercial and open source forms, is one of the most popular load balancers, proxies, web and application servers on the internet today. But Nginx Inc, the company behind the project, wants to cast a wider net, especially now that the way developers are writing and deploying their applications is quickly changing. As the company announced at its developer conference in Portland today, it’s launching the Nginx Application Platform to give developers a one-stop platform for developing or modernizing their applications with DevOps, the cloud, containers and microservices in mind.
Unsurprisingly, the core of the platform is Nginx Plus, the company’s commercial version of Nginx that adds a number of enterprise features to the open source version. On top of that, though, the company is adding Nginx Controller and Nginx Unit. Controller provides a central management and control plane for applications (no matter where they are deployed) and Unit is a modern application server for applications written in PHP, Python and Go (with support for node.js, Java, Ruby Perl and others following soon), that run in dynamic environments. Later this year, Unit will be fully integrated into Controller, so ops teams can manage their Unit applications right from the Controller dashboard.
“The thinking behind Unit is that contemporary application servers aren’t well suited for microservices applications where different languages are used, for example,” Nginx head of product Owen Garrett told me.
The team sees Controller as the bridge between Nginx Plus and the traditional applications that people run on top of it and the modern green-field deployments that many enterprises are now investing in.
Controller will launch in closed beta for select customers in October. Unit is already available.
The existing Nginx Web Application Firewall rounds out the platform. Pricing for the full platform remains up in the air while Controller is still in closed beta.
It’s also worth noting that while Unit will be open source, Controller is a closed-source project. That follows Nginx’s long-standing tradition of keeping some of its commercial products closed-source. “We want to get wide adoption of Unit and to get that, we need to open source it,” Nginx CTO and co-founder Igor Sysoev told me. “We plan for Controller to be a commercial product.” The team tells me that it wanted to get Unit out as soon as possible to get feedback from the community to help it decide on the tool’s future directions.",2017-09-06,1536251,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-85973933.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,nginx,Nginx goes beyond its server roots and launches its application platform,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/nginx-launches-its-application-platform/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Snowflake, makers of a cloud data warehouse service, announced a new virtual private product that should appeal to highly regulated companies like financial services and healthcare.
In fact, the company also announced that one of the product’s earliest customers, Capital One, will be investing $5 million in Snowflake as a strategic investor as a result of this new approach.
Most Snowflake customers use the product in a multi-tenant cloud where users share resources across the service, but the new Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) service gives customers a dedicated set of resources, says company CEO Bob Muglia.
“The key is that it’s dedicated. We are running the data privately and have encrypted computers fully dedicated to [the individual] customer,” Muglia told TechCrunch.
Snowflake has created this private version of its product to meet the very specific needs of regulated customers. In practice, that means each VPS customer gets a managed version of Snowflake inside a dedicated AWS Virtual Private Cloud instance. In addition, they also get control of their own encryption keys and other features like industry-specific compliance such as HIPAA for healthcare and PCI DSS for credit card payments.
As for the investment, Muglia says Capital One’s venture arm, Capital One Growth Venture Partners, took an interest as they were working with the credit card giant, and announced the investment this week after concluding the business side of the arrangement.

Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Dataiku, a French startup that helps data analysts communicate with data scientists to build more meaningful data applications, announced a significant funding round today.
The company scored a $28 million Series B investment led by Battery Ventures with help from FirstMark, Serena Capital and Alven. Today’s money brings the total raised to almost $45 million. Its most recent prior round was a $14 million Series A in October 2016.
Dataiku has developed Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS), which CEO Florian Douetteau says has been designed to solve communications problems between data analysts and data scientists.
“It’s a platform for working together. Data analysts can click around the data while applying machine learning, and data scientists can code and do whatever they want to do to extend the work of analysts,” Douetteau told TechCrunch.
“Data science is no longer a niche subsector of analytics like it was 20 years ago,” Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at investor Battery Ventures said in a statement. “The DSS product enables technical data scientists to work alongside data analysts to help build and deploy models into production. We feel that a platform that allows users of different skill sets to work together is the future of data science products,” he added.
 
Douetteau says the platform is more than just an extension of business intelligence tools we’ve been seeing since the 1990s. His company is enabling the analysts to work on the data in much more sophisticated ways, while collaborating with more technical people in the same interface. As an example, he says that one of the big use cases is media buying.
Say for example that your company wanted to buy ads in Northern Ireland. You could use DSS to find ad data to determine the best time of day to run your ads. You could then find the perfect medium for your ad buy, whether that’s radio, TV, print, online or some combination. The data analysts can manipulate the ad data to the extent that they can, then work with more technical folks to go deeper and generate results that go beyond the analyst level of expertise.
The company, which has a 100 employees, plans to double that number in the in the next few months. That expansion will touch every department including helping customers with deployment and further building out the platform to add more features.
“We want to be the universal platform for data science where you can do anything you imagine for advanced data analytics,” Douetteau said.",2017-09-06,1536144,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-158317656.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"data-analysis,data-analytics,data-science,dataiku",Dataiku to enhance data tools with $28 million investment led by Battery Ventures,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/dataiku-to-enhance-data-tools-with-28-million-infusion-led-by-battery-ventures/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"HPE has been mostly known in recent times for selling off pieces of its business, but it has quietly been on a little run this year buying up cloud companies in an attempt to build out a hybrid cloud business. Today, the company announced it was acquiring Cloud Technology Partners, a Boston-based cloud consulting firm.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
With CTP, HPE gets a consulting firm with experience helping large organizations move to the cloud. One of the big challenges companies face as they make this move is figuring out what to leave on prem and what to move to the cloud. They also often struggle to manage applications across a hybrid infrastructure.
CTP has brings a management suite called Managed Cloud Controls that has been designed to help customers deal with complexity of a multi-cloud approach as it relates to compliance and cost controls in a multi-cloud environment.
The acquisition gives HPE a company that is used to dealing with a myriad of problems related to managing a hybrid setting,  which should give HPE another tool to help customers navigate all of these issues.
This is the fifth company HPE has purchased this year, according to data on Crunchbase.

If this hybrid approach sounds familiar, it should. It’s the same one that many of the legacy tech vendors have been pursuing. Just last week at VMworld, VMware announced a similar strategy and other companies like IBM, Red Hat, Oracle and Dell EMC have gone that way too.
Everyone is seeing the same market opportunity here. HPE is trying to put together a viable hybrid offering, but is a bit late to the game and using acquisitions like this one to play catch-up.

Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Used to be when we thought about identity as it relates to computers and software, it involved a person logging into an application or service. Increasingly though, you also have machines and sensors attempting to authenticate as they access your systems.
That creates complications for identity management vendors because instead of managing thousands or tens of thousands of identities, it could require scaling to millions or even hundreds of millions logons. ForgeRock, a seven year old identity startup says it has built an identity platform with those kinds of scale requirements in mind.
The approach appears to be resonating with investors. Today, the company announced an $88 million Series D investment round led by Accel with participation from KKR, Meritech Capital Partners and Foundation Capital. Today’s investment brings the total to more than $140 million raised to-date.
CEO Mike Ellis sees his company’s approach to identity as a natural extension of what’s happening the industry. “The relationships between humans, devices, things and services is driving security,” he says. He believes it’s also driving new applications for identity and new business opportunities.
It’s something the company has been building towards from the earliest days, a platform than can scale to deal with identity from a variety of sources beyond just human users. “We believe you have to exist everywhere — at the device and gateway level like a connected car, but also on prem and in cloud,” he said.
Ellis admits that his company has flown under the radar compared with better-known identity companies like Ping Identity, which was sold last year for $600 million to Vista Equity and Okta, which went public in May. But he says the timing of the big round is not a coincidence.
He firmly believes as tech makes the shift to machine-to-machine and sensor-to-machine communications in massive numbers, it’s going to require a new kind of identity platform to deal with the volume that will entail. He also not surprisingly sees his company well positioned to take advantage of that shift.
He’s so confident in fact, he says that today’s investment is the first step toward an IPO. That tends to be information that startup CEOs keep close to the vest, but he is not bashful about saying that is his goal. He sees an IPO, not only bringing the next infusion of cash whenever it happens, but also giving the brand a push in the marketplace that only going public can bring.
The company has been doing well to this point with over $100 million in sales in FY2016. It currently has around 400 employees, but intends to add another 100-150 by the end of the year with the new capital. There are also plans to expand the product offering.
ForgeRock currently has about half of its customers inside the US with half outside, but it intends to continue international expansion with some special attention to China in the coming year, Ellis said.",2017-09-05,1535777,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-661551230.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"authentication,iot,identity-management,forgerock",Identity management startup ForgeRock snags $88 million Series D,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/identity-startup-forgerock-lands-88-million-series-d-investment/
Devin Coldewey,Diversity,"It seems like just the other day that Reddit finally banned a handful of its most hateful and deplorable subreddits, including r/coontown and r/fatpeoplehate. The move was, at the time, derided by some as pointless, akin to shooing criminals away from one neighborhood only to trouble another. But a new study shows that, for Reddit at least, it has had lasting positive effects.
The policing of hate speech online has become a flash point for many a flame war, these past few months especially, as white nationalists, neo-nazis and others with abhorrent but strictly speaking quite legal viewpoints struggle with being banned repeatedly from the internet’s biggest platforms.
	
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology took this question seriously, as until someone actually investigates whether such bans are helpful, harmful or some mix thereof, it’s all speculation. So they took a major corpus of Reddit data (compiled by PushShift.io) and examined exactly what happened to the hate speech and purveyors thereof, with the two aforementioned subreddits as case studies.
Essentially they looked at the thousands of users that made up CT and FPH (as they call them) and quantified their hate speech usage. They then compared this pre-ban data to the same users post-ban: how much hate speech they produced, where they “migrated” to (i.e. duplicate subreddits, related ones, etc.) and whether “invaded” subreddits experienced spikes in hate speech as a result. Control groups were created by observing the activity of similar subreddits that weren’t banned.
What they found was encouraging for this strategy of reducing unwanted activity on a site like Reddit:
All in all, the researchers conclude, the ban was quite effective at what it set out to do:
Of course, it’s not so simple as all that. Naturally, many of the users who previously spewed racial slurs at CT just moved over to Gab or Voat, where their behavior is proudly fostered. But the point of the bans at Reddit wasn’t to eliminate racism; it was to discourage it on the platform. To that end, it accomplished its goal (I’ve asked Reddit what it thinks of the study and its conclusions). And similar strategies may work for other platforms.
The question of how to to combat racism and hatred at large is one that is really too much for a major platform like Reddit or even Google or Facebook. The best they can hope to do is strike at it when and where it appears. But as ineffective as that might seem, it worked for Reddit and it may work elsewhere: bigotry is easy and those who cherish it are lazy. Make it difficult and many people may find it more trouble than it’s worth to harass, shame, and otherwise abuse online those different from themselves.",2017-09-11,1539062,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/rtr3lfpe.jpeg?w=738,social/,"racism,censorship",Study finds Reddit’s controversial ban of its most toxic subreddits actually worked,reddit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/study-finds-reddits-controversial-ban-of-its-most-toxic-subreddits-actually-worked/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Facebook doesn’t want you to burn through your mobile data plan just to keep watching its videos. That’s why it’s testing a new feature called Instant Videos that downloads and caches Facebook videos to your phone while you’re on Wi-Fi so you can watch them later on the go for free. Users will see lightning bolt icons on pre-loaded videos.
The Instant Video feature is reminiscent of Instant Articles, Facebook’s hosted content format that loads much faster than mobile websites so users don’t drop off waiting for a publisher’s articles to appear. Because videos load even slower than web pages, publishers might be keen to get involved to ensure maximum viewability for their clips.
The feature could also benefit Facebook’s new Watch tab of original video content, allowing it to cache episodes so people could watch them on a train or elsewhere that they might not have a strong connection or want to use up their data plan watching longer-form videos.
Facebook confirms to TechCrunch that the Instant Video test is available to a small percentage of Android users. A screenshot of Instant Videos was first shared by “Devesh Logendran” using a pseudonym to TNW’s director of social media Matt Navarra. Now we’ve confirmed with Facebook that the goal is to remove data costs as a barrier to watching its videos.
Previously, Facebook has tried to adapt its service for differing bandwidth and data prices by re-ranking News Feed to prioritize low file-size content while downranking videos if you’re on a slow connection, or replaying stories you’d already seen.
While Instant Articles has mostly focused on the speed and convenience of reading news on Facebook, Instant Video focuses on the cost and accessibility. That could make the feature a major boon to Facebook’s efforts in the developing world. There, mobile data prices can be quite high compared to average incomes, and spotty network connections can make watching video frustrating.
But if Facebook wants to be the social network of tomorrow, not just today, it knows it must whole-heartedly embrace video, which can deliver more vivid entertainment and interpersonal connection than text or photos. Interaction with mobile video is skyrocketing, according to a NewsWhip study shared by eMarketer showing a massive 53 percent year-over-year increase in engagement with news outlet videos on Instagram.
Video also carries lucrative advertisements that are closer to the television commercials that brands are accustomed to making. Getting people accustomed to watching organic videos can make them more receptive to watching video ads. Plus, Facebook is starting to allow video creators and publishers to insert video ad breaks into the middle of their clips, and splits the revenue, with 55 percent going to the creator. Instant Videos could potentially include these ad breaks.
By testing Instant Videos on Android, Facebook is laying the groundwork for both serving the developing world where iPhones are more rare, and more budget-conscious teens in the developed world. Combining forward-thinking accessibility initiatives with its engineering prowess and ubiquity could help Facebook excel beyond YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and other competitors that also see video as the future.",2017-09-11,1539045,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/facebook-video-world2.png?w=738,social/,,Facebook tests pre-loaded ‘Instant Videos’,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-instant-video/
Natasha Lomas,Advertising Tech,"Another privacy-related fine for Facebook in Europe: The Spanish data protection regulator has issued a €1.2M (~$1.4M) fine against the social media behemoth for a series of violations regarding its data-harvesting activities.
Spain’s AEPD said an investigation into how Facebook collects, stores and uses data for advertising purposes found it is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent.
It says it identified two serious infringements and one very serious infringement of data protection law — with the total sanction breaking down to €300,000 for each of the first breaches and €600,000 for the second.
The regulator found Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, religious beliefs, personal tastes and navigation — either directly, through users’ use of its services or from third party pages — without, in its judgement, “clearly informing the user about the use and purpose”.
Not obtaining express consent of users to process sensitive personal data is classified as a very serious offense under local DP law.
Facebook’s use of web browsing cookies was also found in violation of privacy laws, with the regulator saying it confirmed users are not informed that their information will be processed through the use of cookies when they are browsing non-Facebook pages that contain Facebook’s ‘Like’ button social plug in — noting that while some of the use of this data is declared as being for advertising, other use is “secret”, i.e. not disclosed by the company.
“This situation also occurs when users are not members of the social network but have ever visited one of its pages, as well as when users who are registered on Facebook browse through third party pages, even without logging on to Facebook. In these cases, the platform adds the information collected in said pages to the one associated with your account in the social network. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the information provided by Facebook to users does not comply with data protection regulations,” it noted.
The regulator is also unhappy that Facebook does not delete harvested data once it has finished using it — saying it had been able to verify Facebook does not delete web browsing habits data, but  in fact “retains and reuses it later associated with the same user”.
It also found this to be true even when the company had been explicitly requested to delete data by a user.
“Regarding data retention, when a social network user has deleted his account and requests the deletion of the information, Facebook captures and treats information for more than 17 months through a deleted account cookie. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the personal data of the users are not canceled in full or when they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were collected or when the user explicitly requests their removal, according to the requirements of the LOPD [local data protection law], which represents a serious infringement,” it said.
The AEPR, which noted it liaised with other DPAs — in Belgium, France, Germany (Hamburg) and the Netherlands, which also have their own separate investigations into these issues, initiated following Facebook’s 2015 T&Cs change — said Facebook’s existing privacy policy was judged to contain “generic and unclear terms”, and to “inaccurately” refer to the use it will make of the data it collects.
The regulator asserted that a Facebook user “with an average knowledge of the new technologies does not become aware of the collection of data, nor of their storage and subsequent treatment, nor of what they will be used”.
It also points out that unregistered Internet users would not be unaware that the social network collects their browsing data — something that has already got Facebook into trouble with other European DPAs.
Commenting on the regulator’s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us the company intends to appeal the decision, while also noting that its European business is (currently) regulated under Irish data protection rules, where its EU HQ is sited.
It provided the following statement:
The size of the AEPR fine is of course a mere pinprick for Facebook whose 2016 revenue was $27.64BN. So really its appeal against the fine is about the company trying to bat away any perception that it violates privacy by refuting the substance of the violations being asserted here.
But seen through the prism of stricter incoming EU data protection rules, under the new GDPR regime which comes into force next May, there are certainly serious financial considerations for Facebook’s business pertaining to privacy — as the new EU regime includes a far larger stick to beat companies that are judged to have violated data protection rules while also tightening up privacy rules by, for example, expanding the definition of personal data and giving EU citizens the right to ask for their data to be deleted.
Companies will be facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for privacy violations under GDPR. So, in Facebook’s case, privacy-related fines could start to scale to over a billion dollars. And penalties of that size aren’t something the tech giant can too often and too easily sweep under its revenue carpet.
Even as GDPR strengthens the consent requirements for processing personal data, and expands the risk of holding and processing lots of personal data.
In addition, a company like Facebook, which processes data across multiple EU Member States’ territories, may find the new regulation creates a situation where it faces more concerted action from other DPAs, i.e. beyond their local data authority where they’ve established a European base. So, in Facebook’s case, it may not so easily be able to claim to be only under the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. And in Europe, it’s fair to say that some DPAs are decided more pro-privacy than others.
Asked about its GDPR preparations, Facebook previously told us it has designated a cross-functional team to “fully analyze the legislation and help us understand what this would mean from a legal, policy and product perspective” — saying this is “the largest cross functional team in the history of the Facebook family”.
It is also now looking to recruit a data protection officer — a position mandated under GDPR.
“Ahead of next May we are working with our product, design and engineering teams to enhance existing products and build new products in a way that simultaneously provides an intuitive, user-centric experience and permits us to meet our obligations under the GDPR,” added Stephen Deadman, Facebook’s deputy chief global privacy officer, in a statement.",2017-09-11,1538681,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/shutterstock_186292982a.jpg?w=738,social/,"gdpr,general-data-protection-regulation,terms-of-service",Facebook fined €1.2M for privacy violations in Spain,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-fined-e1-2m-for-privacy-violations-in-spain/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"Filling out forms online and on mobile can be a tedious and bug-ridden — yet annoyingly necessary — experience. Today, a startup called Typeform has raised a significant round of capital to help fund its mission to change all that, with a platform that the startup claims gets its customers much better results because the interactive experiences created on it are more intuitive and thus easier to engage with.
The startup, based out of Barcelona, today announced a Series B of $35 million led by General Atlantic as it drives deeper into international markets, specifically the US; and expands its tools for developers with more analytics and artificial intelligence features to personalise the experience more. Along with the funding and in keeping with this platform focus, the company today is also announcing a new portal for developers.
“We are proud to be the first company to transform the online data collection space by creating conversational forms. But now we’d like to take things further,” said Robert Muñoz, co-CEO and cofounder of Typeform, in a statement. He believes that Typeform is playing a role in “bridging the gap between data collection and customer interaction.”
This round also included participation from Index Ventures, Point Nine, and Connect Ventures, all previous backers.
In total, Typeform has now raised just over $52 million. The valuation with this round is not being disclosed but in its last funding of around $15 million two years ago, Typeform was worth $70 million post-money, David Okuniev, Typeform’s other cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. He added that this latest funding was an “up-round” and its valuation has grown. (I’m asking around to see if I can get a more current number and will update when and if I learn more.)
He said the company is ‘almost’ profitable.
Other notable investors in Typeform include Anthony Casalena, CEO of Squarespace; Javier Olivan, VP of growth at Facebook; and Jay Parikh, Facebook’s VP of engineering.
It sometimes happens that the most successful startups are founded in response to an enterpreneur’s frustration with an existing product or service. And so it was the case with Typeform. Co-founders Muñoz and David Okuniev are both designers — specifically with focuses on interaction, UX, and UI — and were running their own agencies back in 2011, when they found themselves working jointly on a single brief (for a toilet company of all things).
When the client asked for a new form to help pick up new business leads and more customer data, the pair were unable to find any suitable online templates or platforms that would not only get users to fill out their information with reliable regularity (no pun intended to the toilet company) but provide details that could be used for sales in the future.
“We felt there was a lack of attention given to engaging users in the first place,” Okuniev said, who added that the interaction that had been invented for forms hadn’t changed since the 1990s. 
The two set out to build something themselves, and then used that as the basis of what became Typeform, first launched in 2012, a more dynamic form-creating interface that presented questions one at a time. “We wanted to address that in a serious way, but you could also say it was accidental,” Okuniev said. “We had no intention of building a startup out of this.”
Today, creating basic online forms is nearly a commoditised business, with companies like Google offering products like Forms free of charge, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter letting people create free polls and other services, and so on.
Unsurprisingly, Typeform has been iterating on its original product over the years, and today concentrates more on APIs and other developer tools, which are offered in a freemium model based on usage and additional features.
At the same time, the startup has very much pushed into making its service something that one can use in any scenario where a user might need to enter data: from basic information entry like job application and contact forms; through to surveys; registration forms; shopping and order forms; online learning and tests; and invitations.
The flexibility of the platform, and the focus on making more dynamic interactive experiences, translates into results. Okuniev said that the average conversion rate on one of Typeform’s forms — whether it’s a questionnaire, customer service request, quiz, poll, order form, or something else — is 57 percent, compared to a conversion rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent for more conventional forms. 
Its success is also playing out in user numbers. Today, Okuniev said that the company has 30,000 paying customers, and “a lot more” than this using its free tier. Customers include both small and medium sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies in the tech, retail, and hospitality industries.
Typeform’s today describes its form-filling platform as “conversational”, but its original concept behind that pre-dates a lot of the talk we hear today about conversational AI, and bots.
On the other hand, Typeform’s ethos is also very contemporary: it focuses on presenting and asking for information using conversational language, and works on the basis of feeding questions one at a time and getting answers in return and tailoring subsequent questions based on those responses.
That being said, today, the startup does not use any AI in its platform, although it’s being considered, either by growing it in-house (today the company has around 170 employees, including engineers), or by partnering with an existing firm, or potentially through an acquisition.
“AI is definitely on our minds,” Okuniev said. “We are doing some projects internally around user behaviour around form entry and we will be integrating that into the product soon. We want to help our customers generate more conversations, and we think our products could help with that.”
The focus on creating an interactive platform based around natural language is one reason why investors were interested in helping fund the startup to grow.
“Digital forms are transitioning from a simple data-collection tool into an integral part of the customer engagement journey,” said Chris Caulkin of General Atlantic, in a statement.
So, too, is the platform flexibility. “If you think about the proliferation of device types and browsers, including forms and data collection can be a real pain point,” Caulkin said in an interview. “And the solution that Typeform has developed can be easily integrated and managed by the product, not the tech, team.”
Caulkin is joining Typeform’s board with this round.
The interactivity and square focus on sales and customer relationships also makes the company a prime target for acquisition, in my opinion, with companies such as Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Microsoft/LinkedIn and many others all looking at better ways to help businesses interface with users, particularly across platforms with more tricky interfaces, like mobile. In the meantime, Typeform is also working on integrating more with other, existing platforms, such as Mail Chimp.",2017-09-11,1538674,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/7.jpg?w=738,social/,"crm,forms,general-atlantic,typeform","Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Subverting the 140 character limit by chaining tweets together into a cohesive “tweetstorm” takes some know-how, or you’ll screw it up. Luckily Twitter has built but not yet launched a feature for easily composing tweetstorms. Hidden inside the current Android app is a way to write out a tweetstorm and see it broken into distinct tweets, then tweet them all at once.
By institutionalizing tweetstorms with a graphic user interface, Twitter could make sharing expanded thoughts more accessible to everyone. Whether it’s telling a suspenseful story, stringing together breaking news facts, or going on a long-winded rant that should have been a blog post, tweetstorms let you distribute deeper and more nuanced content.
Under the pseudonym Devesh Logendran, a Twitter user passed on their sighting of the tweetstorm feature to TNW’s Director of social media Matt Navarra. Twitter told us “No comment to share on the record” when we asked about the feature that refers to tweetstorms as “threads”. We have no additional information on if or when this feature will ever launch, but have learned that it’s not currently available for public testing.
Popularized by tech investor Marc Andreessen, coined by fellow VC Chris Dixon, and vilified by BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel, tweetstorms have been a Twitter power user trick since at least 2014.
Typically, you need to know to reply to you previous tweet one at a time to build a tweetstorm, not just tweet separately or reply the first tweet. A lot of people make these mistakes, causing their storms to get broken up in the timeline.
Whether making tweetstorms easier is good for the information density and consumption trends of Twitter is up for debate.
Some think you should either condense your thoughts into a tweet or two, or right a separate blog post and link to it. Others think the serialized format can offer a special reading experience and reach a wider audience than an offsite blog. Either way, the Twitter sorting algorithm deemphasizes content with weak feedback, so if tweetstormers are boring their audience, they’ll pay the price in visibility.

But one of Twitter’s core problems is that it doesn’t feel approachable for the average joes and janes, leading to its weak user growth the last few years. Seeing tweetstorms and not understanding how they work, or messing up when you try yourself can discourage people from sticking with the app.
Twitter’s already made a wise push to simplify itself in other ways, like dropping media embeds or usernames in replies from the character count. Launching a tweetstorm button could remove one more confusing block from the wall dividing Twitter from the mainstream.",2017-09-10,1538527,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/twitter-lightning.png?w=738,social/,,Twitter has an unlaunched tweetstorm feature,twitter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/tweetstorm-button/
Natasha Lomas,Media,"New research by Pew suggests there has been another increase in the proportion of U.S. adults getting news via social media platforms.
In May last year the researcher reported that 62 per cent of American adults were obtaining news from tech platforms, saying 18 per cent were doing so often. Now, in it’s latest survey, it says two-thirds (67%) of U.S. adults are reporting getting at least some of their news on social media. While a fifth (20%) report doing so “often”.
And while it’s not a huge increase, it is nonetheless a rise (Pew terms it a “modest” increase).
And a concerning one, given that the main social media purveyor of news — Facebook — has a demonstrable disinterest in and/or incapacity to distinguish fact from nonsensical fiction on its platform.
Indeed, as many have already pointed out Facebook’s business benefits from increased user engagement, and made-up stories that play to people’s prejudices and/or contain wild, socially divisive claims have been shown to be able to clock up far more Facebook views than factual reports of actual news.
So any rise in news consumption on social media should give pause for thought — especially as Facebook (and Google, principally) continues to suck ad revenue away from traditional media outlets, threatening the sustainability of businesses that have traditionally played a key role in a functioning democracy.
Pew’s survey is based on responses from 4,971 U.S. adults who are members of the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel. The research was carried out between August 8-21, 2017.
It said it found that growth in news consumption across social media platforms is being driven by increases among Americans who are “older, less educated and non-white” — noting that for the first time in Pew Research Center surveys more than half (55%) of Americans aged 50 or older report getting news on social media sites — up 10 percentage points from 2016.
Pew found that three of the social media platforms it asked about in 2017 — Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat — had an increase in the share of their audience that gets news on each site.
About three-quarters (74%) of Twitter users reported getting news on the site, up 15 percentage points from early 2016.
While about a third of YouTube’s users (32%) now get news from the site, up from 21% in early 2016 — so a rise of 11 percentage points.
And consuming news also rose among Snapchat’s user base — with 29% currently saying they are doing this, up from 17% in early 2016, so an increase of 12 percentage points.
Still, Facebook remains the primary social media platform for sourcing news for the U.S. population as a whole — with just under half (45%) of all U.S. adults reporting they get news on the site (aka a large majority — 68% — of Facebook’s user base).
How times change. Just a year ago Facebook was pooh-poohing the notion that the social mega-platform is playing the role of a media company. ‘We are mere tech platform’ was the refrain in September 2016, despite how its algorithms select and order news-related content for billions of users.
By December, and following the fake news backlash after the US election result, that line was approaching the breaking point of credibility, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded Facebook might indeed be a media company — though he suggested it’s not a ‘traditional’ one.
And that is surely true. No other media entity on Earth has enjoyed such vast reach and power.
Little wonder Russian agents spied potential to sew social division across the U.S. population as the country was headed into the salient point of an election cycle by purchasing, targeting and distributing politically charged ads via the platform — as Facebook this week revealed had been the case.
It reported that an in-house investigation found pro-Kremlin entities appear to have purchased around $100,000 in political marketing on the platform between 2015 and 2016.
The company has so far resisted pressure to publicly reveal the ads purchased by Russian entities.
Returning to Pew’s report, its survey also found news consumption growing among YouTube’s (also growing) user-base — saying the Google/Alphabet-owned user generated video platform is now the second most common social media site for news, with roughly two-in-ten (18%) of all U.S. adults getting news there.
For Twitter, Pew said that while a very large share of its users (74 per cent) obtain news via the site, given that its user base is also significantly smaller than Facebook’s or YouTube’s this results in a smaller overall reach for news: With just 11% of U.S. adults get news via Twitter.
The researcher concluded that Americans are now more likely than ever to report getting news from multiple social media sites — with around a quarter of all U.S. adults (26%) getting news from two or more sites, up from 18% in 2016.
In additional research it also said its data shows the Internet is closing in on television as a source of news. As of August 2017, 43% of Americans report often getting news online, compared with 50% who often get news on television — so just a seven-percentage-point gap. While in early 2016 the gap between the two news platforms was 19 points.
So, in short, the Internet’s social platform giants are busily consuming broadcast/TV news media, not just print.",2017-09-09,1538357,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/26984_385686912308_7387506_n.jpg?w=720,social/,"pew,united-states,social-media,digital-media","Even more US adults now getting news from social media, says Pew",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/even-more-us-adults-now-getting-news-from-social-media-says-pew/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Some Facebook users have noticed a new section called “Movies” appearing in the mobile app’s main navigation. The feature, which has just appeared for many U.S. Facebook users, offers a way to see which movies are playing nearby, available showtimes and a list of local theaters and their movie selections. The section is powered through an integration with Fandango’s and Atom Tickets’ booking services, which means you can also buy a movie ticket right from the “Movies” section itself.
This is not the first time Facebook has powered movie ticket sales, to be clear.
Last fall, it introduced a way for visitors to Facebook Pages to take various actions, like getting quotes, buying event tickets from Ticketmaster and buying movie tickets, among other things. At the time, the movie ticket sales were being made possible through a partnership with Fandango, and had begun with just a few titles in U.S. theaters, like The Magnificent Seven, Storks and others.
The interface for those movie ticket sales from Facebook Pages looks just like the one you’ll see from the Facebook app’s “Movies” section, currently.

That indicates this is more of an expansion of the existing relationship with Fandango, rather than something entirely new to Facebook. That is, instead of having to visit an individual movie’s Facebook Page to start the purchasing process, you can just go to a single destination in the Facebook app. That makes it simpler to see all the movies playing nearby and complete your transaction.
For Fandango, its interest in working with Facebook went beyond purchasing ease, Paul Yanover, Fandango’s president, told The New York Times last fall. It was also about the ability to connect groups of friends who would go see movies together.

But for Facebook, the feature is now one of many that have launched in its main navigation in recent months, as the social network is shaping up to become a portal that offers anything you’d need online. In other words, Facebook wants to keep you in its app instead of having you turn to Google, or seek out other mobile apps to perform a task, get information, use a service, etc.
For example, the company has added features to its app’s main navigation that include a way to order food delivery; a Town Hall for connecting with local, state and national government representatives; access to your daily weather and forecast; an Explore feed for finding new Facebook Pages you might like; a selection of trending news items; a way to watch the top Live videos; a QR code scanner; a Wi-Fi finder; easier access to Safety Check; a networking-focused “Discover People” section; and many other options. And that’s not the complete list.
We understand that the Facebook “Movies” button is considered a test, and has been slowly expanding to users across the U.S.
That means some of you will have seen this option long before now, while others are only newly seeing it. It’s very difficult to tell when Facebook actually launches new features, because of how it tests products with small audiences, then larger ones and then sometimes decides to yank the feature or make it publicly available.
Movie tickets aren’t the only type of ticket that Facebook is selling these days, we should also note. Its “Marketplace” section is rolling out a “ticket sales” section, too, which allows local event hosts to promote their events inside Facebook’s Craigslist-like feature.
Post updated 9/9/17, 9:30 AM ET, as an Atom Tickets integration has now gone live.

Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"WhatsApp is preparing to finally monetize, and its first move follows the same strategy as Facebook Messenger. TechCrunch has discovered code in Facebook’s ad manager that lets businesses buy ads with the call to action “Send WhatsApp Message.”
We reached out for comment and a WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch “We’re testing a new way for people to start a chat with a business in WhatsApp from a Facebook ad. This makes it easier for people to connect with businesses that they care about on WhatsApp.” They clarified that for now, WhatsApp isn’t selling ads on its own app, but testing a WhatsApp chat button on Facebook ads that directly opens a conversation with a business in WhatsApp.
The Next Web’s Matt Navarra initially spotted the WhatsApp name in Facebook’s ad manager code, in a way that didn’t describe how the ads work. Upon further investigation, TechCrunch found this “Send WhatsApp Message” code.

This week WhatsApp announced its plan to eventually charge businesses, stirring worries that businesses might be able to cold-message users with sponsored message ads. But WhatsApp tells TechCrunch that businesses will only be able to contact WhatsApp users that have agreed to be messaged by initiating the conversation. That’s the same way Facebook Messenger-sponsored messages work, where businesses can pay to reconnect with people they’re already chatting with.
So, a business could use the tested Facebook ads feature to get users to spark conversations with their company, and then have the ability to contact them in the future, potentially through sponsored messages. For example, an e-commerce business could buy Facebook ads that start a conversation with its style consulting service on WhatsApp, then later message that user with promotions for new clothing lines.
This was the first way Facebook Messenger began monetizing in 2015 though “Click-To-Message” ads that lived on Facebook proper. Messenger eventually began injecting display ads into the inbox, which WhatsApp could one day allow, too. Alternatively, it could charge large enterprises like banks or airlines for special management of high volumes of messages or e-commerce and customer service transactions.",2017-09-08,1538057,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/whatsapp-money1.jpg?w=738,social/,facebook-messenger,WhatsApp’s first ads appear on Facebook and start convos with businesses,"facebook,whatsapp",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/whatsapp-ads/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"TweetDeck Teams — a feature that lets users share access to Twitter accounts without having to share a password — will now work in the Twitter app for iOS and Android. This change will make it easier for those who run social media accounts for businesses and brands to post updates, check replies, send direct messages and more, without having to run a separate app.
If anything, however, the move could hint that Twitter is thinking of transitioning TweetDeck’s account management features to its main app. After all, many of TweetDeck’s more advanced features, like muting, search and list management, already exist on Twitter itself. It only makes sense that shared accounts would make their way over, too.
TweetDeck hasn’t had a lot of attention since Twitter bought the app for $40 million back in 2011. Instead, following a small update in 2012, its features have slowly disappeared or failed to keep up with those on Twitter’s official clients. Twitter also shut down TweetDeck’s mobile apps a few years ago, then discontinued its Windows client last year. (Windows users were directed to use TweetDeck via the web.)
Meanwhile, TweetDeck’s Mac app hasn’t been updated since mid-2015 on the Mac App Store.
Now, one of TweetDeck’s bigger selling points is making its way over to Twitter, with this support for Teams.
Twitter quietly announced the news on Thursday via a couple of tweets pointing to updated help documentation detailing how the feature works.
Before this change, admins and contributors could only use TweetDeck Teams accounts in TweetDeck itself, so this broadens their availability.
After the Team is set up, users may be invited to join the Team via an email notification, a notification in TweetDeck or a push notification to Twitter for iOS and Android. They can then accept or decline from any of those places, including the Twitter mobile app. Here, Twitter users will tap their profile icon and look for “Team Requests,” then tap the checkmark icon or “x” to accept or decline.
Once a part of a Team, Twitter for iOS and Android users can tweet, Direct Message, Like and Retweet from a Team account using the main Twitter mobile app.

Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Reddit revealed today that it has teamed with Lucidworks to provide a long-needed, modern search tool for the immensely popular online discussion platform.
When you face the kind of scale that Reddit does with over 300 million monthly active users generating 5 million comments and a staggering 40 million searches every day across a more than a million communities, it’s a daunting task to find a search tool to handle that kind of volume.
The challenge with Reddit extends beyond indexing these massive numbers. They also have to deal with wide variety of content with text, gifs, images and video by the score. While part of the goal was to improve traditional search functionality and deliver more relevant results, perhaps even more critically, they wanted a tool to help users surface the subjects that interest them without having to explicitly state it in the search box, Nick Caldwell, VP of engineering at Reddit explained.
“I think that people who come to any site, and Reddit in particular, prefer an experience where they don’t have to do manual keyword entry, but want a continuous stream of interesting content,” he said.
Reddit’s search engine had actually been notoriously bad and Caldwell made upgrading it a priority. “One of the things I wanted to do when I started at Reddit, was I wanted to fix [search]. People have been complaining about it for five years,” he said.
Part of the issue up to that point wasn’t a lack of desire to improve the search experience. Everyone understood the issue, but finding the time to update it was another matter. When Caldwell came on board, Reddit had a small team of 40 engineers, whose primary job was keeping a site of this size and scope up and running.
Caldwell said that the company went with the Lucidworks Fusion platform because it had the right combination of technology and the ability to augment his engineering team, while helping search to continually evolve on Reddit. Buying a tool was only part of the solution though. Reddit also needed to hire a group of engineers with what Caldwell called “world class search and relevance engineering expertise.” To that end, he has set up a 30-person engineering search team devoted to maximizing the potential of the new search platform.
Lucidworks is built on the open source search tool, Apache Solr, but company CEO Will Hayes says the commercial product has been built to scale to Reddit-like proportions. “Solr is the core engine. We still heavily contribute to the open source project, but we put a lot of focus on how people consume data,” Hayes explained.
The means working in a streaming fashion to span billions of records in near real time, while using analytics and machine learning to understand the underlying data and deliver more relevant results and content to Reddit users.
Today’s search update is part of Reddit’s wider campaign to update the site’s look and feel, which became an organizational priority after the site’s two founders returned to the company — with Alexis Ohanian coming back in 2014 and Steve Huffman in 2015.
“With Steve and Alexis coming back, they brought to table that the site should be more welcoming and engaging than it has been in the past. It took the leadership of Steve and Alexis to see that the content we have is really a gold mine, and we have to find a way to present it to users to unlock that potential,” he said.
While Lucidworks remains an active partner in the project, Caldwell hopes his team will be able to take over by the end of the year. He says the ultimate goal is a tool that is not only more relevant, but looks better and is more engaging.",2017-09-07,1537088,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-472334136.jpg?w=738,social/,"online-discussion,search,lucidworks",Reddit teams with Lucidworks to build new search framework,reddit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/reddit-builds-brand-new-search-framework-with-lucidworks/
Taylor Hatmaker,Social,"To boost the popularity of Stories, Facebook could turn to its photo-centric sister app. In a new feature test first spotted by the Next Web’s Matt Navarra and Twitter user @mruiandre, some users are seeing an option to share Instagram Stories directly to the main Facebook app. Instagram has since confirmed that the feature is indeed in testing.
Facebook added its own version of Stories earlier this year, but the feature hasn’t taken off with the same gusto as its Instagram counterpart. The company could solve that problem by mixing Instagram content into Facebook itself, as users seem perfectly happy posting on-the-fly photo and video updates to the photo-sharing app.
The move would be an interesting intermixing of content between the two apps, which have remained mostly separate (much to the relief of Instagram loyalists) since Facebook first bought Instagram back in 2012. Instagram users have been able to share individual photo and video posts to their Facebook News Feeds for a long time now, though no content travels the other direction.
Instagram Stories already has aggressive placement in its own app, appearing on a separate bar above normal Instagram posts. The company added the Snapchat copycat feature back in August 2016 and the feature’s popularity is likely largely the cause of Snapchat’s slowed growth in 2017. Since that whole Instagram Stories thing appears to be going so well, porting it over into Facebook proper isn’t a bad idea — it’s just another benefit of having a whole suite of apps that you can pick and choose from in order to fine-tune the main money-maker.",2017-09-06,1536920,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/facebook-stories-ios.jpg?w=738,social/,"facebook-stories,instagram-stories",Instagram test feature lets users share Stories straight to Facebook,"facebook,instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/instagram-stories-on-facebook/
Darrell Etherington,Social,"Twitter’s dark-toned ‘Night mode’ interface theme is now rolling out to its web client, after debuting first on its iPhone and Android apps. The dark theme will let you more easily monitor key real-time information from your Batcave to help make sure Gotham is safe if you happen to be Batman – and it could also ease eye strain when you’re using Twitter’s website at night or in low light.
The ‘Night mode’ look is actually a dark navy, rather than black or gray, which is probably a better choice for general legibility. It also makes my cover art (a picture of a print I purchased of the X-Men’s Charles Xavier drawn by terrific Canadian comic artist and illustrator Michael Cho) look even more intimidating, which is to my liking.
This might not be immediately available to everyone, but if it is, you can enable it by clicking on your own icon in the top right corner of the Twitter web interface and tapping that ‘Night mode’ toggle at the very bottom of the menu that pops up.

Josh Constine,Apps,"Today Facebook officially opened its new Watch tab of original video content to everyone in the U.S. after a limited rollout a month ago and expansion to some more users last week. Available on Facebook’s native mobile apps, desktop site, and TV apps, Watch lets users subscribe to their favorite series instead of just haphazardly stumbling upon one-off videos in the News Feed. U.S. users will now see the TV icon in the mobile navigation bar and desktop site bookmarks.
Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to ensure that user generated videos don’t get taken down for including music owned by the major record labels. Bloomberg reports Facebook is offering the labels hundreds of millions of dollars for a deal that would let infringing videos stay up, rather than be removed to the great annoyance of users.
Facebook had planned to build out a YouTube Content ID-style system so labels could detect uses of their music and claim a cut of monetization from then instead of just issuing blunt takedown notices. But Bloomberg says that system could take up to two years to build, and Facebook is willing to pay now to stop the takedowns.
Facebook is offering a range of different options for discovering video content, including a carousel of featured programs, and sections like “Today’s Spotlight”, “New This Week”, “Popular Now”, “What Friends Are Watching”, “Most Talked About”, “Suggested For You”, and a special “10 Minutes Or More” spot for long-form videos.

For now, Facebook is primarily highlighting reality shows, which partners are producing en masse since they’re cheap, don’t require set scripts, and can be watched piece-meal. But to really seduce audiences who frequent YouTube, Netflix, and cable TV, Facebook will need high quality scripted comedies and dramas.
One of the first signs of this content is the sci-fi short film ‘Lost Memories’ by independent filmmaker Francois Ferracci about a future “over-saturated by holograms”. Beyond that, its current offering isn’t very appealing, as the shows lack stars, big budgets, or cliff-hangers. But if you’re the type to just turn on the Discovery Channel and lay back on the couch, you might find some fun time-wasters on Facebook Watch.",2017-09-05,1536327,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/facebook-watch.png?w=738,social/,"facebook-video,facebook-watch",Facebook Watch original video tab launches to all U.S. users,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facebook-watch-tab/
Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"WhatsApp is gearing up to finally monetize its messaging app by charging large enterprise businesses for tools to better communicate with customers. WhatsApp will also offer a free app to small-to-medium sized businesses, though it hasn’t outlined the specific functionality of the app. The enterprise solution will allow global companies “to provide customers with useful notifications like flight times, delivery confirmations, and other updates”.
“We do intend on charging businesses in the future,” WhatsApp’s Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema told the Wall Street Journal. “We don’t have the details of monetization figured out.”
The company did write that it wants to facilitate “someone placing an order with a local bakery or looking at new styles from a clothing store” and “shopkeepers who use WhatsApp to stay in touch with hundreds of customers from a single smartphone”, plus offer “an easier way to respond to messages.”
Perhaps WhatsApp could charge enterprises like “airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks” to have multiple representatives managing an account or sending high volumes of messages. It could also charge for artificial intelligence bot functionality or ecommerce transactions.
WhatsApp also officially announced its closed pilot program for verifying business accounts with a green checkmark to distinguish them from personal accounts and fakes.
WhatsApp began testing verified accounts for businesses a week ago. Conversations with businesses are encrypted and they can be blocked. Interestingly, if a business isn’t already in your phone number contacts, its name will appear as whatever they register themselves as instead of their number. This could allow WhatsApp to create a business search engine with optional sponsored results, or let businesses cold-message people, possibly for a fee.
Alternatively, businesses on WhatsApp may need to be contacted by a user first before they can respond with organic or sponsored messages. That’s how Facebook Messenger works, and it’s led to businesses buying “tap-to-message” ads on Facebook’s News Feed to get people to initiate conversations so the business can follow up with sponsored messages. Not allowing cold-message ads meshes with WhatsApp writing that it plans to “make it easier for people to communicate with the businesses they want to reach on WhatsApp”, emphasis mine.
[Update: WhatsApp now confirms our hunch, telling TechCrunch “Businesses will only be able to contact people who have provided their phone number and agreed to be contacted by the business over WhatsApp.”
The company also says that the enterprise solution will initially be free but it does plan to charge businesses. Some functionality that will be offered by the Business app and enterprise solution includes the ability to create a verified profile with info like address, description, and hours, plus “Features for helping manage customer chats like away messages for when businesses are not able to respond at the moment.”]
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, the companies said they wouldn’t put ads in WhatsApp because it would degrade the experience. But it also ditched its $1 annual subscription fee, leaving few monetization options beyond charging businesses for tools. The introduction of display ads and sponsored messages to Facebook Messenger may indicate a relaxation of WhatsApp’s stance against ads.
With over 1.3 billion monthly users and 1 billion daily users, WhatsApp has reached the massive scale necessary for it to earn significant revenue even from light advertising. Its Snapchat Stories clone WhatsApp Status now has 250 million daily users, and could host vertical video ads between friends’ content the way Instagram does. It could also insert display ads into the inbox like Facebook Messenger.
After being one of tech’s biggest startup acquisitions, WhatsApp has tripled in size under relatively hands-off management by Facebook. Now it’s time to earn its keep.

Lucas Matney,Government,"Social media sites have had a pretty interesting year when it comes to approaching filter bubbles and echo chambers and the real world effects that come when they effect something like a national election. Verrit is a fledgling media startup that’s aiming to provide a platform for Hillary supporters to look at infographics with quotes on them about stuff they agree with.
Verrit got a big boost yesterday when Hillary herself tweeted out an endorsement of the platform to her nearly 18 million Twitter followers.
For Clinton supporters the site aims “to become their trusted source of political information and analysis; to provide them (and anyone like-minded) sanctuary in a chaotic media environment; to center their shared principles; and to do so with an unwavering commitment to truth and facts,” according to a blog post. The site frequently references “the 65.8 million,” i.e. the number of votes Clinton received in the 2016 election.
Shortly after the Hillary endorsement, the site suffered a cyber attack substantial enough to make it inaccessible for much of Sunday night. Today, it has returned with some added protection thanks to Cloudflare.
CEO Peter Daou isn’t just a wayward founder who lucked into a Hillary endorsement of his product. He served as Clinton’s “Internet Director” in her 2008 presidential campaign and was a digital media strategist for her in years prior. After that he led ShareBlue, a left-leaning media site seemingly primed for those who find Salon to be a tad too centrist.
He seems to be excited about the attention from Verrit.
Philosophically, the site is a bit on the smug side, arguing that progressive-minded Hillary supporters need a home on the web away from the hustle and bustle of trolls and trump-ets to get their information. For those who were worried that other social media sites weren’t already echo chambers, Verrit basically codifies that into its mission. It wants to be a “sanctuary” for Hillary supporters.
Creating a media organization that isn’t absorbed in the 24-hour news cycle and can take a step back to approach topics on a deeper level is certainly not a bad idea, but building one that is supposed to make up for the biases of the mainstream media against liberals in a purely reactionary tone with the explicit backing of former staff of Hillary Clinton doesn’t exactly seem to be a recipe to bringing about solutions to political turmoil.
Then again, this is 2017 where products that espouse “free speech” as a central tenet are almost guaranteed to be hubs of hate speech. Just a couple weeks ago, social network Gab was booted from the Google Play store for failing to show “sufficient level of moderation.”
Even so, Verrit has its own issues with user-generated opinions. The site’s commenting policy is a bit unsavory, suggesting that instead of just not allowing you to post a comment if you’re in violation of its policy, Verrit will actually change the text itself before posting. “We reserve the right to alter or remove terminology that violates our policy before publishing a comment.”
The site’s big deal is that each post is part of a larger system system for verifying news snippets, but it doesn’t really appear to solve anything other than that it comes from sources trusted by Verrit. Each Verrit infographic has a seven-digit code on the bottom which sources to the website as a way of linking the image to its sourcing.
It’s not exactly revolutionary and furthermore none of the sources are actually linked so if you really care you’ll have to scour the web to find where the claim is from, especially when it just tells you the name of the publication. Seeing “Source: CNN” isn’t necessarily going to inspire any faith from Trump supporters used to the President’s habit of spouting “fake news!” at stuff he doesn’t agree with. Then again, this site isn’t meant for those people, just the 65.8 million.
Even though the interface functions pretty well, it’s not really clear whether Verrit’s format actually does a good job at conveying info. Some complex topics are pretty difficult to express succinctly and Verrit hasn’t exactly shown its deftness in doing so.
Verrit has every hallmark of a “here today, gone tomorrow” media startup but that won’t stop similar ideas from going forth with similar mission statements while similarly failing to solve the political divide.
“Verrit can only grow with the help of those whose values it reflects and serves,” a blog post reads. “…Together we can reject revisionism and tell our own story with integrity and honesty.”
