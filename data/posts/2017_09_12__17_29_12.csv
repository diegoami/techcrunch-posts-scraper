Josh Constine,Apps,"Despite the tepid reception for Facebook Stories, the social network is doubling down on its full-screen Camera feature. Today Facebook added the ability to go Live, shoot two-second GIFs and share full-screen text posts on colored background from Facebook Camera, which lets you share to Facebook Stories, Direct messaging and the traditional News Feed.

The features give Facebook Camera near parity with Instagram’s Stories camera, and could make it more flexible and attractive to teens looking for ways to share visually. Combining the Camera’s augmented reality face filters with Live could make people more comfortable broadcasting since they won’t have to show their real face.
Facebook had already offered colored backgrounds for status updates through the traditional composer. It tested a GIF creator in Camera last month. And Facebook tested Live via Camera earlier this month, after allowing users to go Live from the News Feed composer since 2016. But now Facebook is officially rolling out these features to all iOS and Android users.
Facebook globally launched Camera and 24-hour ephemeral Stories in March, declaring war on Snapchat directly after fighting by proxy via Instagram since last year.
But while Snapchat clones Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status have both surpassed the original to hit 250 million daily users, Facebook hasn’t given updates on how many people use its Camera and Stories. Critics in the West, where Snapchat and Instagram are popular, have dubbed Facebook Camera “redundant.” Some ask why we need multiple Facebook-owned properties to share the same Stories. Others find the Story bubbles atop the feed obtrusive, especially when people seem to be pouring very little content into the distribution channel. Right now only four of my friends have a Story posted.
But between Facebook’s launch of the augmented reality Camera Effects Platform in April and today’s addition of new features, Facebook seems hell-bent on making its Camera popular. It could always cut and run, folding Facebook Camera and directing users to Instagram Stories. But if Mark Zuckerberg is convinced video and visual communication is the future, and is betting Facebook can lead by offering an AR development platform Snapchat lacks, the company may be willing to take its lumps and wait for the trends to push people to Camera.",2017-08-15,1527172,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/facebook-stories-ios.jpg?w=738,social/,"facebook-live,facebook-stories,facebook-camera","Facebook boosts snubbed Stories Camera with Live, GIF & text sharing",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-camera-gifs-live/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Snapchat’s got a new trick to stay one step ahead of Instagram by turning everyone’s quick video clips from concerts into a much more watchable music video you control.
Snapchat “Crowd Surf” uses artificial intelligence machine learning technology to analyze when lots of people are all recording the same musical performance at the same time. It can then lace together the different angles while keeping the song playing smoothly so you can choose where to watch from and see more than 10 seconds of footage in a row. You can see a demo recorded by TechCrunch below:
https://youtu.be/xQkapLhuGV0
Snap tested out Crowd Surf last night at pop singer Lorde’s performance at San Francisco’s Outside Lands music festival. When she played her hit “Green Light” and everyone thrusted their phones in the air, Snapchat combined the clips. You can watch the Crowd Surf in the Snapchat “Featured” section below your friends’ recent Stories, and tap to see a new angle whenever the flipping phone Crowd Surf icon is lit up.
The result is remarkably fun to watch. You can hop from the center of the crowd to the front row to the side stage to get an immersive look at what it was like to see the concert in person. In fact, I did see the show in person, but Crowd Surf lets me watch how everyone else was enjoying the same moment.
Several now-defunct startups like Vyclone and CrowdSync have tried to build whole apps around the Crowd Surf idea, but most failed because they weren’t getting enough content submissions. Bolting the feature onto an already wildly popular app should prove more successful for Snapchat. The company pioneered the crowdsourced Our Story three years ago at the EDC music fest, and now it’s back pushing the bar higher.
Which begs the question…how long until Instagram Stories copies this? Both Snap and Instagram are in a heated war for users, with Snap inventing new features and Facebook’s giant Instagram team quickly cloning them to the detriment of Snap’s growth.
Each wants to encourage users to submit their posts for public display. Snap lets you syndicate your post to Our Stories before you share it, which then appear in curated Our Stories, search results, and the new Snap Map. Instagram Story Search pulls together posts tagged with locations and hashtags for dedicated Stories about different places and topics.
We’ve asked Snapchat for more details on how Crowd Surf works. The company says it’s based on in-house AI technology and will roll out slowly to more events. Mashable spotted it this morning. Snapchat previously offered Story Explorer that let you check out similar Snaps to one you enjoyed during a Live Story by analyzing location and time, but not audio.
Crowd Surf is set to be available at more public events in the future including concerts and speeches, but will require tons of people shooting and submitting Snaps from the same moment. That could limit it to huge events like music festivals, though perhaps it could work for parades, sports events, or political rallies too. And the mere existence of the feature could attract more submissions.
If people think their Snaps could get chosen for Crowd Surfs and get extra viewers, they might be more likely to shoot and share on Snapchat when they’re watching a concert.",2017-08-14,1526828,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/snapchat-music.png?w=738,social/,snapchat-clone,Snapchat “Crowd Surf” stitches together everyone’s concert videos,"snapchat,instagram",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/snapchat-crowd-surf/
Sarah Perez,Media,"Facebook is rolling out a “Trending News” section on mobile that includes its own link in the app’s main navigation. This follows the company’s earlier announcement this spring of a redesign for Trending Topics, an increasingly important part of Facebook’s social network, where it tracks the news stories that are buzzing across its service. That redesign is now rolling out to users on iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., while the added navigational link to Trending News became available on iPhone over the past few weeks, and is in testing on Android, Facebook tells us.

In case you missed Facebook’s announcement in May, the Trending Topics section was redesigned with a focus on making it easier to see how other publications are covering a topic, in addition to what friends and public figures are saying about the matter.
When you click into a Trending Topic following the update, Facebook explained you will see a carousel of stories from other publications that you swipe through horizontally.

The publications linked to in this section are determined by engagement around both the article and publisher in general on Facebook, as well as what other articles are linking to it.
This card-style carousel look-and-feel was inspired in part by Facebook Paper, the company’s long since shuttered standalone news reading app.
This carousel is still in the process of rolling out across the U.S.
However, one aspect to Trending’s makeover that wasn’t really touched on during Facebook’s earlier announcement was how Facebook was toying with a redesigned list of news stories that focused on headlines, not just “trending topics.”
The original look for Facebook’s Trending Topics – which you pull up with a tap into the app’s search box – is a simple list of topics and the beginning of a lede that’s usually cut off. These appear below your own recent Facebook searches in the app.
However, if you access the new Trending News link that’s just popped up in Facebook’s navigation menu, you’ll see an entirely different sort of Trending section.

Above: Old Trending on left vs New Trending on right
Instead of a “topic” (often just a word, person or place, like “China” or “Donald Trump”) and squiggly arrow icon, the news stories here include a headline, a photo, the name of a major media outlet that’s reporting it, and how many other sources are available on the topic.
For example, next to the headline, it might say: “Reuters and 100+ other sources.”
Plus, by adding the photo next to each item, there’s more room for expanded information – that is, a full headline and sourcing.
The new section also gives stories a rank (#1, #2, #3,…etc.)
Facebook’s prior announcement in May didn’t specifically detail how this Trending News section looked different from Trending Topics.
Frankly, it’s all a bit confusing, because Trending Topics and Trending News don’t seem to be tied directly together at this point. For example, you could have the link to Trending News in your app’s main navigation, but still not have the new look for Trending Topics, which includes the carousel redesign.
However, in that same post, we did get a little peek at Trending News – but it was referenced as being a part of a “small test.”

Trending integration in News Feed still a “small test”
Facebook said then it was testing adding the top three Trending News stories to users’ News Feeds. In a screenshot of this, you were able see this list of stories with photos that were ranked by numbers, as well as stories identified by headlines instead of just “topics.”
This integration of a “mini” Trending News section into News Feed is not broadly available. That remains a “small test,” we understand.
But the addition of the Trending News link to Facebook’s navigation is already live on iPhone, and being trialed on Android.
Of course, any changes Facebook makes to Trending are sure to met with a lot of scrutiny. The company last year faced criticism when it removed its human editors who curated this section, to run Trending by way of algorithms instead. (And those algorithms soon screwed up.) The social network has more recently made several changes to address the spread of fake news and filter bubbles, as well.
In this case, though, Facebook is not monkeying with how news is selected as “Trending,” only how it’s being displayed.
The new Trending News section joins a number of other new additions to Facebook’s main navigation as of late, including the food ordering option, Town Hall, weather, the Explore feed, and more. Not all these additions have stuck around – the new travel-focused City Guides section, for instance, has since disappeared.",2017-08-14,1525266,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fb-mobile-news-feed-photos-ios.jpg?w=738,social/,"mobile,news,apps","Facebook is rolling out a Trending News section on mobile, now with its own link",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/facebook-is-rolling-out-a-trending-news-section-on-mobile-now-with-its-own-link/
Darrell Etherington,Apps,"Snapchat is teaming up with The Pokémon Company to introduce a new Pikachu filter to the app. The official Pikachu filter applies the electric mouse’s trademark rosy cheeks, pointy ears, black nose and big eyes to faces in the app, and when users open their mouth the iconic Pikachu cry rings out as an animated version of the characters leaps into frame.
The Pikachu filter is a pretty perfect tie-in for Snapchat, which aims at a demographic that is already pretty gaga for the most recognizable of Nintendo’s pocket monsters. Plus, Snapchat could use some brand juice, and Pokémon and Pikachu have proven to offer that for a lot of other platforms, including any of Nintendo’s hardware consoles and even AR via Pokémon Go.
Snapchat’s Pikachu filter is a limited run option, so if you want to capture yourself looking like Ash’s best pal you’d better get on it. The best strategy is probably to stockpile a wide range of selfies of yourself as Pika so you have one for every possible emotional response you can possibly make.

Katie Roof,Apps,"Snap, the Snapchat parent, has had a very difficult ride in the stock market since debuting in March. After pricing its IPO at $17 and then reaching highs of $27, the company has fallen to less than half that. After losing 14 percent of its value in a single day’s trading, Snap closed Friday at $11.83.
The growing social media company revealed on Thursday that it has 173 million daily active users, up more than 20 percent since last year. But that wasn’t enough to impress Wall Street, which was expecting more than 175 million users.
Analyst expectations are always built into the stock price and missing them will cause shares to plummet. And Snap not only missed on user growth, but revenue and losses, as well. 
The company brought in $181.7 million in revenue, a 153 percent increase from last year, but investors were expecting more than $186 million. But losses also increased substantially, $115.9 million for last year’s quarter versus $443.1 million for this year.
The success of Instagram Stories is one of the main reasons that investors are skeptical of Snap. Instagram copied its short-form video feature last year and has seen tremendous success. The Stories feature already has 250 million daily users, over 75 million more than Snap.
Snap also recently found out that it won’t be in the S&P 500, which is a significant blow because a lot of investors buy that index. And it looks like the company’s Spectacle glasses aren’t selling well.
The bull case for Snap is that the team has been innovative. The company popularized disappearing messages and came up with the stories idea. Snap also has been clever with its use of AI-enhanced face filters. But in order to survive as a public company, the team will have to come up with something that can’t be so easily replicated.
TechCrunch’s Josh Constine has a few ideas. ",2017-08-11,1526362,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-google-snapchat-stories-news.png?w=738,social/,snap,Another record low for Snap after 14% drop post-earnings,snapchat,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/another-record-low-for-snap-after-14-drop-post-earnings/
Josh Constine,Apps,"SoundCloud has just closed the necessary funding round to keep the struggling music service afloat. CEO Alex Ljung will step aside though remain chairman as former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor replaces him. Mike Weissman will become COO as SoundCloud co-founder and CTO Eric Wahlforss stays as chief product officer. New York investment bank Raine Group and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek have stepped in to lead the new Series F funding round of $169.5 million.
SoundCloud laid off 40 percent of its staff last month, with 173 employees departing in an effort to cut costs. The company only had enough runway left to last into Q4, and today's investor decision was viewed as a do-or-die moment for the company. Now it will have the opportunity to try to right the ship, or sail into an established port via acquisition.
SoundCloud declined to share the valuation or quantity of the new funding round. Yesterday, Axios reported the company was raising $169.5 million at a $150 million pre-money valuation. That's a steep decline in value from the $700 million it was valued at in previous funding rounds. The new Series F round supposedly gives Raine and Temasek liquidation preferences that override all previous investors, and the Series E investors are getting their preferences reduced by 40 percent. They're surely not happy about that, but it's better than their investment vaporizing.
Raine will get two board seats for bailing out SoundCloud, with partner and former music industry attorney Fred Davis, and the vice president who leads music investments, Joe Puthenveetil, taking those seats.
While abdicating the CEO role probably wasn't exactly what Ljung had hoped for, at least he gets to stay on with the company as chairman of the board. ""This financing means SoundCloud remains strong, independent and here to stay,"" he wrote.


SoundCloud says its total revenue is now at a $100 million annual run-rate. If it can keep costs low and grow that number, it may eventually get to break even and no longer need infusions of investor capital.
TechCrunch broke news about the magnitude of the SoundCloud crisis last month. Sources from the company told us the layoffs had been planned for months, but SoundCloud still recklessly hired employees up until the last minute, with some being let go within weeks of starting. Employees told TechCrunch that the company was ""a shitshow"" with inconsistent product direction and dwindling cash. Ljung was seen as reluctant to be honest with the team, and unfocused as he partied around the world like a rock star.
Our report led to a flurry of follow-on coverage, prompting fans and artists to speak up in favor of the service. The rally was reminiscent of the love shown to Vine after Twitter announced it would shut down. Popular musician Chance The Rapper tried to get involved to save the company. He, like many other indie hip-hop artists, made their name on the platform as part of a genre that came to be called ""SoundCloud Rap."" In the end, SoundCloud was saved when Vine wasn't.
For now, music and other audio saved on SoundCloud is safe. But the company will need to find a way to make its subscription tiers more appealing and scale up its advertising despite having much less staff to drive the changes. If it can't, SoundCloud could be back begging for cash in a year.
The new management should provide some additional confidence. I've interviewed both Ljung and Wahlforss in the past, and neither had answers to the big questions facing SoundCloud about its product direction, business model and the spurious copyright takedowns that have eroded its trust with musicians.
Trainor may be able to institute some more discipline at the startup. He was the CEO of Vimeo from 2012 to 2016, and has poached his former COO there to help run SoundCloud. They helped Vimeo fend off bigger rivals like YouTube by doubling down on what was special about the service: a focus on high-quality artful film rather than amateur viral videos. That experience makes Trainor a great fit to lead SoundCloud, which is fending off bigger rivals like Spotify and Apple Music.
SoundCloud's best bet isn't to battle them directly, but double down on the user-uploaded indie music scene, including garage demos, DJ sets, unofficial remixes and miscellaneous audio you can't find elsewhere. Whether it stays independent long term or tries to seduce an acquirer, SoundCloud will benefit from spotlighting its unique community of creators and hardcore listeners.",2017-08-11,1526192,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/soundcloud-money-alt.jpg?w=738,social/,"soundcloud,streaming-music",SoundCloud saved by emergency funding as CEO steps aside,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/soundcloud-saved/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Snap has an awful Q2 earnings report… but at least its dancing AR hot dog was viewed 1.5 billion times. To prove their confidence, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy have agreed not to sell any shares this year, and the company will withhold shares they’re owed to pay for any necessary taxes. Of course, there are only five months left in the year, so this isn’t exactly a long-term lock-in.
One concrete metric announced was that Snap generated $5.4 million in “Other” revenue, which would equate to around 41,500 pairs of its Spectacles camera sunglasses at a $130 price point. That’s compared to $8.3 million in Q1 and $4.5 million in Q4.

Josh Constine,Apps,"SoundCloud will soon collapse if investors don’t vote for a rescue funding round tomorrow. The stumbling music streaming community site had to suddenly lay off 40 percent of its staff last month. Now it’s asking investors for $169.5 million at a pre-money enterprise valuation of just $150 million, according to Axios‘ reliable business editor Dan Primack. That’s a steep drop from the $700 million valuation of its previous rounds.
If SoundCloud doesn’t get the funding, CEO Alexander Ljung reportedly told investors that SoundCloud won’t be able “to continue as a going concern.” That could force SoundCloud to sell even though Ljung has stubbornly fought to keep the dying startup independent. If it can’t find funding or a buyer, SoundCloud could vaporize, destroying its massive archive of user-uploaded music, podcasts and other sounds.
Investors would be forgiven their distrust since SoundCloud has burned over $230 million in funding plus $70 million in debt with little monetization progress to show for it.
[Update: At least this new funding deal would bring in new management. Recode reports that former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor would replace SoundCloud CEO Alex Ljung if investors do provide the funding.]

Last month we detailed the many, MANY problems with SoundCloud. Employees told us the company is “a shitshow,” with a lack of product direction, talent leaving and employees secretly using Spotify.
Rather than focus on its unique value proposition of being the “YouTube for Audio” with demos, DJ sets and remixes available nowhere else, SoundCloud chased dreams of grandeur as it tried to evolve into a Spotify competitor. But after taking years to negotiate deals with the major record labels, the extremely late $9.99 SoundCloud Go+ subscription service flopped. Meanwhile, it had burned credibility with core users like DJs by removing their music over dubious copyright claims while trying to suck up to the labels.
SoundCloud lavishly spent money on offices around the world while its CEO galavanted at music festivals like a rock star. SoundCloud recklessly wasted money, hiring people up until the moment it announced they’d be immediately let go as part of the 173 layoffs it announced last month. Now staff morale is in the toilet, the user experience is a mess, the subscription models are unappealing, competitors are growing rapidly and musicians are fleeing to other upload platforms.
That’s why it seems crazy for investors to fund a $170 million Series F to keep a sinking ship afloat a little longer unless SoundCloud is willing to swallow its pride and get acquired for whatever it can get.
The new investors would be Raine Group and Temasek, plus existing backers Union Square Ventures, Doughty Hanson and Atlantic Technology. They’d at least get preferred stock that’s paid out upon exit before previous investors. But how are they to know they won’t get diluted too when SoundCloud runs out of money again? The new deal would reportedly reduce the liquidity preference of the previous Series E investors by over 40 percent.
We reached out to SoundCloud PR and its CEO for comment or clarity on the do-or-die fundraise, but didn’t hear back.
Investors’ best bet is to fund a small bridge round just big enough for SoundCloud to shop itself around and find a buyer. Perhaps Google would buy it to align the YouTube of Audio with the YouTube of YouTube. Or Amazon could step in and try to do for musicians what it did for book authors by creating a convenient aggregated marketplace, though acquiring Pandora might better mesh with Amazon’s mainstream demographic.
SoundCloud has proven it can’t manage itself. It’s too damaged, too in debt and too far behind to thrive independently without a miracle turnaround. No matter what, the whole service is on shaky footing, so musicians may want to archive their audio and start promoting their presence somewhere safer.",2017-08-10,1525623,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/soundcloud-money.jpg?w=738,social/,"alex-ljung,soundcloud",SoundCloud faces do-or-die vote by investors,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/soundcloud-shut-down-possible/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Discord wants to destroy its biggest, best-funded competitor in the battle to be the communications layer for gaming. It wants to be the home for gamer clans strategizing and trash-talking with each other. After out-gunning its gaming-specific competitors like TeamSpeak, Mumble and Ventrilo with a secret $50 million fundraise earlier this year, Discord is setting its sights on Skype.
Today Discord expands beyond text and voice with the launch of video chat and screensharing. Now friends can watch each other play their favorite games while talking face-to-face. These features could further addict Discord’s 45 million users, 9 million of whom use its web, desktop and mobile apps each day.

“This is the most requested feature on Discord probably a year running,” says CMO Eros Resmini. “A lot of infrastructure had to be built up for this launch,” he warns, though, since the video features run at a remarkably smooth and crisp 720p at 30 frames per second. Skype runs at half that FPS. My briefing with the company was held over its new video chat, and it looked much better than what’s standard.
That’s why only 5 percent of users will get video today, and it will only work with groups of up to 10 people. Embodying Discord’s playful style, the company explains that “It’s possible that we’ll need to completely turn off video calls during this test. If you find the feature is missing all of a sudden, we suggest you lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling until it’s fixed.”
If the video launch goes smoothly, Discord could snatch gamers from its competitors that either lack video entirely, or do screensharing poorly like Skype, as they weren’t built for conveying rapid-fire action with sharp graphics. One big thing that’s lacking is sound from screenshares, which Discord will need to figure out.
Video chat could be a stepping stone for Discord to start competing with massive one-to-many broadcasting channels like YouTube and Twitch.

Discord was originally a game developer itself, making the critically acclaimed but publicly ignored mobile battle arena Fates Forever. “We couldn’t figure out how to get over the hump on the monetization side,” Resmini says. So in late 2014, it started tinkering with other ideas.
CTO Stan Vishnevskiy had been dreaming of a tool like Discord. “I played MMORPG [Massively multiplayer online role-playing games] 15 hours per day,” he told me, and was dissatisfied with TeamSpeak and Mumble. Those required IP addresses that could be attacked by trolls, rented servers and clumsy apps. “Can we make a 10X project? Low-friction usage, no renting servers, beautiful design we took from mobile.”
Discord launched in May 2016 and has been a rocket ship ever since. It’s now raised a total of $79 million, including the $50 million round led by Index Ventures in January 2017. The 70-employee startup now handles 200 million messages per day and up to 4 million concurrent users as groups chat about World of Warcraft, OverWatch, League of Legends and Clash Royale.
The startup earns money from $5/month subscriptions to its Nitro tier, which gives users cosmetic upgrades and a few bells and whistles. “Discord has made the promise to our user base of keeping the core Discord experience free,” says Resmini. But the company is considering launching in-app purchases to enhance the new video features and earn some extra cash.

The company insists that the majority of its users are gamers chatting with small groups of friends, where someone calling someone else a colorful, profanity-laced name is more a joke than a harassment issue. But there are some larger public servers for entire sub-Reddits where people discuss topics beyond games, and Discord has unfortunately found itself used by hate groups to coordinate trolling and harassment.
“We focus on giving people tools and controls so they never get in a situation that they’re with a stranger that’s doing something you don’t think is OK,” says Resmini. “You can block folks, you can leave places, you can remain in a private space.” The team also relies on users to report abuse to its team trained to quickly banish harassment, doxing and other problems.
Some startups, like subscription crowdfunding platform Patreon, have taken a relatively permissive approach to dealing with hate-mongers, and decline to comment on incendiary topics like Gamergate. That’s why it was encouraging to hear Discord speak candidly about its disapproval of the alt-right and sexism in the gaming business.
“Their ideologies aren’t welcome,” Resmini declares. “We don’t like people that act that way, people that harass people. We’re on the side of gaming that’s a positive community. That’s an inclusive community.”

Still, Discord won’t proactively jump in unless there are abuse reports. “We don’t read people’s private servers. We believe in privacy at Discord. The censorship thing is something we’ve stayed away from. We think it’s a very slippery slope,” Resmini admits. But once hatred surfaces, it’s comfortable dealing out lifetime bans and deletions of servers.
If Discord ever wants to become a mainstream communication tool for gaming culture that’s grown increasingly popular worldwide, it has to keep things clean and friendly, even if that means friends laughing while they swear at each other. “Some of the happiest times of my life have come from gaming,” Vishnevskiy concludes. “And things that make me happy, I want to bring to others.”",2017-08-10,1525626,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/discord-video.png?w=738,social/,"teamspeak,video-games,discord",Discord steals gamers from Skype with video chat and screensharing,skype,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/discord-video/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Facebook has a new home for original video content produced exclusively for it by partners, who will earn 55 percent of ad break revenue while Facebook keeps 45 percent. The “Watch” tab and several dozen original shows will start rolling out  to a small group of U.S. users tomorrow on mobile, desktop and Facebook’s TV apps.
By hosting original programming, Facebook could boost ad revenue and give people a reason to frequently return to the News Feed for content they can’t get anywhere else.
Watch features personalized recommendations of live and recorded shows to watch, plus categories like “Most Talked About,” “What’s Making People Laugh” and “Shows Your Friends Are Watching.” Publishers can also share their shows to the News Feed to help people discover them. A Watchlist feature lets you subscribe to updates on new episodes of your favorite shows. Fans can connect with each other and creators through a new feature that links shows to Groups.

Facebook says it plans to roll out access to Watch to more users and more content creators soon, starting with the rest of the U.S. before expanding internationally. Users with access will see a TV-shaped Watch button in the bottom navigation bar of Facebook’s main app that opens the new video hub.
Facebook admits that “we’ve also funded some shows” as examples, but notes that these are only a small percentage of all the available shows. “We want any publisher/creator who is interested to be able to create a show in the future,” a Facebook spokesperson tells me. “So there will be hundreds of shows at launch, and we’ll hopefully scale to thousands.”
Business Insider reported some leaked details about the redesign earlier today, but pegged the launch of original programming as starting August 28th, when the shows actually will begin to roll out tomorrow.
Facebook’s shows will run the gamut from live event coverage to reality TV to scripted programs.  “More and more people are coming to Facebook in order to watch video” Facebook’s director of video product Daniel Danker tells me. “When they come with that in mind, we want to make a place for them where they can find that video, connect with the creators and publishers they love, and know they won’t miss out if there’s a new episode from one of those creators.”
Here’s a list of some of the original programming that will be available on Watch:
What’s clearly absent is the type of longer-form scripted dramas and comedies people are used to watching on television. Instead, there are plenty of mini-documentaries, reality shows, and sports coverage.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes that “We believe it’s possible to rethink a lot of experiences through the lens of building community — including watching video. Watching a show doesn’t have to be passive . . . You’ll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.”
When you open Watch, you’ll be able to scroll through a long list of categories of shows to view. Alternatively, you can either swipe over or arrive from a notification about a new episode to view the Watchlist of all the lastest shows released by creators you follow. Once you’ve opened an episode you’ll see all the details about it, with one tab for joining a live comment reel with other viewers, and an “Up Next” tab displaying what you’ll view after the current episode if you prefer a glazed-eyes lean-back experience.
There’s no specific content restrictions on swearing or violence beyond Facebook’s existing community standards, but Facebook will monitor for shows that get flagged.
Publishers can choose to insert ad breaks if they want to earn money off their shows, though the guidelines on where and how long they can be are still being finalized. If publishers want to give away their content, they don’t have to show ads. Another option is to do product placed or branded content, in which case the creator has to tag the sponsor paying them for transparency. Shows will have their own dedicated Facebook Pages, and creators can set up special show Groups where fans can ask questions and geek out together.
Beyond the Watch tab, you can also discover shows through the News Feed if a publisher you follow posts an episode or friends are talking about it. That gives Facebook the opportunity to artificially boost the presence of shows in News Feed to build a bigger audience for the new content initiative.
Facebook first launched its dedicated video tab in April 2016, but it only hosted the more generic News Feed videos people were already seeing from Pages and friends. Now Facebook is in the business of funding original content, initially through direct payments, though it seeks to switch entirely to a revenue-share model in the future to make its original programming effort sustainable.
Facebook’s competitors like YouTube and Snapchat have already experimented with creating original video content. YouTube Red funds several original series, giving bigger production budgets to some of its biggest stars. Snapchat has tried making its own shows in-house, but now focuses on signing deals with partners like TV studios to get fresh, vertical video content into its Discover section.
Facebook’s benefit is that Watch is cross-platform, allowing people to view videos from all their devices, while also being a daily destination for 1.32 billion users. It’s already become a powerhouse in serendipitous video discovery via the News Feed, and Watch will surely provide enough suggestions to get people hooked on shows they weren’t expecting.
But through premium original programming, Facebook is also trying to become a home for deliberate video consumption where people come to view a specific show. While there are already plenty of reasons to visit Facebook, original shows give people a reason to spend longer staring at their screens. If it can drive enough viewers to these shows thanks to its 2 billion total users, Facebook could offer significant revenue-share payouts, attracting better and better content creators.
Facebook’s been trying to eat the whole internet for years now. With Watch and these shows, it’s breaking out of the web to challenge traditional television, which is seeing viewership slide. As ad spends follow eyeballs from TV to the web, Watch could give Facebook a way to net more attention and dollars.",2017-08-09,1525400,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/facebook-watch-tab1.png?w=738,social/,"facebook-video,original-content",Facebook launches Watch tab of original video shows,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/facebook-watch/
Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"“Cloaking” sounds sci-fi, but it’s actually a trick used today by spammers to show content moderators or search engine spiders an innocent-looking version of their site while real visitors just see ads and scams. For example, some spammers try to fool Facebook’s review team and tech by showing any of its staffers’ IP addresses a benign landing page for links or ads, while everyone else sees diet pill scams or porn that violate Facebook’s community standards and ad policies.
So today, Facebook is cracking down on cloaking. Facebook ads product director Rob Leathern tells me now when it discovers a site using cloaking, “We’ll deactivate their ad counts, we’ll kick them off, we’ll get rid of their Pages.” Facebook will use both humans and expanded artificial intelligence systems to root out cloakers. However, it’s not publicly disclosing the signals it uses to identify cloaking so it doesn’t tip-off the spammers.
Innocent businesses should see no impact. “There’s no legitimate use case for cloaking,” Leathern says. “If we find it, it doesn’t really matter who that actor is. They’re usually bad actors and spammers by definition. So the line is if anyone does this in any way, shape, or form, we want them off the platform.” Here, Facebook is merely seeking out cloaking, rather than passing judgement on site content.
The change comes as part of a multi-pronged attack on hoaxes, clickbait, spam and low-quality sites following criticism that Facebook didn’t prevent fake news from influencing the 2016 presidential election. By cutting off traffic to spam sites, Facebook can choke out the financial lifeblood of bad actors spreading misinformation for profit or political motives.
According to a recent study of 4 million posts by more than 450 Facebook Pages spreading hyperpartisan political news, BuzzFeed concluded that “Publishers are obsessed with Facebook’s algorithm changes and with avoiding getting caught up in the social network’s stepped-up initiative to reduce clickbait and misinformation in the News Feed.”
Cloaking isn’t just a Facebook problem, though. That’s why it plans to work with other tech companies to share strategies for defeating cloakers. Facebook tells me it’s early days in these conversations with the industry about how to address this more collectively. But if it shares the fingerprints of cloakers the way it does to thwart uploads of terrorist content or child pornography, Facebook could use experience from its massive scale to inoculate fellow fixtures of the internet.",2017-08-09,1525108,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/clickbait.png?w=738,social/,"facebook-news-feed,spam,facebook-fake-news",Facebook bans ‘cloaking’ of spam sites that fool filters,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/facebook-cloaking/
Jon Russell,Apps,"If you’re sick of politics, sport and general world news then you’re probably best off avoiding social media altogether.
But if you want to have your cake and eat it, there is another option to prevent unwanted items filling up your precious timeline on Twitter. Try Mute, a way to quickly mute 100 words from Twitter as chosen by the wisdom of people on the internet — aka crowdsourced.
Twitter has long supported muting words, but Mute makes it easy to really get into the feature. Its Mute.life website lists 100 keywords that have been added and then voted on by visitors to form a ranked list. By installing a bookmark in your (Google Chrome) browser, Mute can be used to automatically add those top 100 words into your muted word list for Twitter.
To get started, visit Mute.life and follow the instructions on the left-side of the screen. You can mute individual words, but the process behind that is pretty cumbersome since it involves copy-paste and manual entry. A better approach may be uploading the full 100 and then removing those you words that you don’t want to mute. Consider Mute the starting point.
I took Mute — which was created by nomadic developer Pieter Levels — for a spin and it worked as advised. Within a few minutes I had 100 muted words set up.
The only problem was the crowd — the main selling point — since many of the words I had muted weren’t topics that I wanted to banish from my timeline altogether.

That said, I’m not really the target audience here. I can’t remember muting any/many keywords over the years. But, if you’re someone who is looking to make use of Twitter’s mute feature, then this service gives you a jump start at doing that.
Levels said on Product Hunt that he is working to bring Mute to Facebook — that’s certainly a feature that would appeal to more people, so we’ll stay tuned on that.
Update: Facebook muting is now supported too — full details on the website here.",2017-08-09,1525011,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/twitter-mute-filter.png?w=738,social/,"mute,pieter-levels",This app quickly mutes 100 crowdsourced topics from your Twitter timeline,twitter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/mute-twitter/
Anthony Ha,Advertising Tech,"Advertisers on Facebook’s Audience Network will no longer have to worry that they’re paying for users who accidentally clicked on their ads.
I’m betting we’ve all had moments where we were scrolling or swiping or clicking through a website/mobile app and we ended up clicking on an ad without really meaning to. (Those moments probably outnumber the times I’ve intentionally clicked on an ad.)
So Product Marketing Manager Brett Vogel said Facebook won’t be charging for those clicks in its Audience Network (where Facebook runs ads in other apps), and those clicks won’t be included in the metrics shared with advertisers and publishers.
Facebook is sorting out unintentional clicks by discounting instances where a user bounces back after two seconds or less. After all, if you clicked on an ad and then immediately clicked back, you probably didn’t care about the ad.
Still, Vogel said the two-second threshold is a “starting point” that Facebook can adjust if necessary.
Publishers may worry that this change could hurt their bottom line, but Vogel said the “vast majority” will not be affected, because their ads aren’t driving a significant number of unintentional clicks. He added that Facebook is making the change for the good of the ecosystem.
“Unintentional clicks end up delivering really poor experiences for people and advertisers,” he said. “It’s not a good path for publishers to build sustainable businesses.”
In addition, Facebook is also announcing that it’s making new ad metrics available (it’s been making a broader push around this).
Those metrics including gross impressions, a number that combines billable impressions with non-billable impressions — advertisers aren’t paying for things like non-human traffic, but some of them have still asked to see the numbers. Facebook is also adding auto-refresh impressions (those are ad impressions for banners on the right-hand side) and gross auto-refresh impressions.",2017-08-08,1524391,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/facebook-video-money.png?w=738,social/,,Facebook says it’s removing accidental clicks from its ad network,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/facebook-unintentional-clicks/
Jordan Crook,Apps,"Swarm has been through a lot of changes since it launched in May 2014.
The app, which originally debuted as a social utility to let people check-in to locations and meet up with their friends, has since shifted to a gamified location-sharing app. Today, the company is looking to revamp the app once again, with a new focus on lifelogging.
So much of our lives is now contained within searchable data. We store our memories in Instagram and Facebook, revisit our years-old micro-thoughts on Twitter, track our health with apps like Clue and FitBit, and the list goes on and on. Swarm, with the launch of version 5.0, wants to be the best at telling you about where you’ve been in the real world.
That starts with a brand new home page, simplifying the app considerably. The old Swarm launched you into a page with five tabs at the bottom and two tabs at the top, offering the ability to look at your own check-ins as well as the check-ins of your friends.
Now, the home screen has just three tabs: Me, Check-in, and My Friends.
“Historically, our biggest challenge has been to make things simpler as opposed to more complex,” said Foursquare cofounder and Executive Chairman Dennis Crowley. “It’s very easy to continue adding features, but we challenged ourselves to remove 70 percent of the complexity from the app so that users can understand it right away.”
Swarm 5.0 launches directly into the Profile (Me) tab, with an interactive map at the top showing you exactly where you’ve been. At a glance, I can see that I’ve been to 671 places across 77 categories, making up a total of 1,277 check-ins.
Below the map, you’ll find your own timeline of events, including who was there with you and how many coins you received. More importantly, however, the profile page offers a fantastic search tool. Users can search by friends they checked in with, city, category, or even the type of restaurant.
This should make it easier for users to remember where they’ve been no matter how much time has passed.
At the top of the Profile page is your profile picture. Clicking into it will take the user to their personal insight page, letting users check on their mayorships, their top categories, sticker progress, photos, and friends.
Speaking of, the Friends feed is also somewhat simplified, integrating the old “Games” tab into the friend timeline to show where you stand on the leaderboard. And, as expected, users can follow along chronologically with their friends check-ins from this page, which is also searchable.
Notifications on friend requests and incoming direct messages can also be found on the top right of the Friends page.
The check-in screen is the most familiar in the new Swarm 5.0. The app automatically decides where you are instead of sending you into a search page, with easy options to change location quickly.
All the same accoutrements, like stickers, text, friend-tagging and photos, are all available in their usual spots. However, alongside the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, Swarm has now added an Off-The-Grid button for folks who want to check-in without broadcasting their location to their friends.
“We were seeing a lot of people ask ‘what the heck is this thing?’,” said Crowley. “Super users stuck with the app but we were losing a lot of new users in the meantime. This version of the app is designed so users can really understand the story behind it and hopefully fall in love with it.”
Swarm has seemingly come full circle from its origins within the old Foursquare, letting users log their locations in a searchable fashion. After ditching mayorships and leaderboards in the first iteration of Swarm, those things are now alive and well. After trying and failing to introduce a social utility that lets friends meet up in the real world, the core of Foursquare check-ins has remained.
In short: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.",2017-08-08,1524566,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hero-banner.png?w=738,social/,"dennis-crowley,swarm","Swarm kills the clutter, focuses on logging location",foursquare,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/swarm-kills-the-clutter-focuses-on-logging-location/
Sarah Perez,Apps,"Facebook is paring down its collection of standalone apps. The company’s experimental “teens-only” app Lifestage, designed to counteract Snapchat’s threat, has been pulled from the App Store. Its disappearance was first spotted by Business Insider, and Facebook confirmed its removal. However, Lifestage isn’t the only Facebook app that’s being killed off as of late – the company is also closing down its Groups app, first launched in 2014 to help users better discover, search and connect with their various Facebook Groups.
In its announcement about the Groups’ app’s closure, Facebook said it believed the team could do more for the community by working on improvements to Groups within the main Facebook app.
It seems that’s been the case for some time, however. The Facebook Groups app had grown to be very buggy in recent months, often to the point of becoming unusable. And it didn’t look like Facebook had any interest in fixing those glitches, much less continuing to roll out improvements to the Groups app overall.

Groups, I’d argue, ultimately failed because it didn’t address the problem with using Groups on Facebook at all. There was no News Feed in the app where you could browse just Group posts without Page updates and status updates from friends mixed in; there was no universal search across your Groups; and there was no way to organize Groups into collections for easier access, among other oversights.
The app itself has already been removed from the App Store, and will stop functioning for existing users on September 1st, Facebook says.
While Facebook Groups is still a key focus for the social network going forward – if not as its own, separate mobile experience – it’s not as surprising that Facebook shutting down Lifestage.
That app, by design, targeted a limited user base – only those 21 or younger could even sign up. Launched last year by then 19-year old product designer Michael Sayman, Lifestage put a heavy emphasis on video and on getting to know your friends through a Q&A type experience.
But Facebook no longer needs a direct counterpoint to Snapchat. It has Instagram. In April, Instagram’s Stories feature hit 200 million users, surpassing Snapchat’s user base of 161 million. As of this month, Instagram Stories has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million.
The company has blatantly ripped off some of Snapchat’s best features, like its augmented reality and selfie filters. Its ability to clone Snapchat’s features is speeding up, TechCrunch’s Josh Constine also recently noted. Though it took nearly three years to launch its version of Stories, Instagram was able to copy the “create your stickers” feature in four months.
That leaves little need to continue to focus on an app like Lifestage, which never became an App Store success. At the beginning of August, it was ranked #1,392 on the iOS’s free charts in the U.S., and unranked on Google Play.
This is not the first time Facebook has cleaned house of under-performing apps. A couple of years ago, it closed down its internal incubator Creative Labs, along with several of its apps, including photo-sharing app Slingshot, anonymous chat app Rooms, and collaborative video app Riff.",2017-08-08,1524635,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/lifestage-android.jpg?w=738,social/,"groups,mobile,lifestage",Facebook shuts down its Snapchat competitor Lifestage and its standalone Groups app,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/facebook-shuts-down-its-snapchat-competitor-lifestage-and-its-standalone-groups-app/
Jordan Crook,Apps,"The launch of iOS 10 and its iMessage Store has launched emojis and stickers into mainstream communication. In fact, 6 billion emoticons are sent every day. And a new startup called MojiLaLa is looking to capitalize, both figuratively and literally.
MojiLaLa is a marketplace that lets artists submit their sticker packs to the iOS store with zero hassle, for free.
The company has just raised $1.5 million in seed funding from Great Oaks Ventures and betaworks ventures, and IVP partner Dennis Phelps.
Founder and CEO Dana Loberg, a former artist, says that the process of submitting art to the App Store requires learning XCode, owning a Mac and iPhone, and $99. MojiLaLa does all the heavy lifting for artists for free, letting them focus on their artwork instead of their business development.
MojiLaLa lists these sticker packs within iOS on behalf of the artists, and splits revenue 50/50. Loberg says that, eventually, the company plans to expand artist revenues to an 80 percent share once the visual communication revolution is in full swing.
Alongside listing sticker packs for artists, MojiLaLa also has its own app (MojiLaLa Unlimited) that lets users subscribe to get complete access to over 25,000 stickers. Users pay $1.99/month to get access to these stickers, and artists who opt-in to list on MojiLaLa unlimited get an extra level of visibility for their work.
As we advance closer to mainstream AR/VR experiences, a relationship with artists become incredibly important. Artists are the ones who create the face filters we use in Snapchat, and the virtual objects we’ll interact with in Facebook Spaces, and that list will only continue to grow.
MojiLaLa wants to position itself as the over-arching representative of those artists in the tech world, handling all the back-end expertise and heavy lifting while giving artists the opportunity to put their work on the platforms we use the most.
MojiLaLa has integrations with platforms like Kika Keyboard, Baidu, Giphy, Line, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft, Skype, Gfycat, and Telegram, with more than 2,000 artists on the platform.
Eventually, the company wants to start brokering partnerships between brands and artists for branded sticker packs.

Sarah Buhr,Apps,"Lonely Planet has a new app for travel enthusiasts. Called Trips, the app uses an Instagram-like design populated with beautiful images of far away places.
Much like Lonely Planet’s website, the idea behind Trips is to offer travelers an easy way to share their experiences and discover new areas of the world — this time on their smartphones.
However, Instagram already has a healthy amount of travel enthusiasts uploading photos of fantastic places for viewers to check out on a daily basis. National Geographic, a personal favorite, is one of the most popular on the platform, with a following of nearly 80 million. Lonely Planet, by comparison, has about 1.4 million followers on the platform.
Like Instagram, you can “heart,” share and follow profiles on Trips, as well. But Lonely Planet’s Daniel Houghton says the intention is not to compete with the social media giant, but to complement it.
Lonely Planet is an O.G. travel site and has its own loyal niche of travel enthusiasts. Perhaps an app focusing precisely on their passion will be well received.
Trips is Lonely Planet’s second app. The online destinations site launched its first app Guides last year, which provides “tips and advice from on-the-ground experts.” More than one million people have since downloaded Guides. Lonely Planet hopes Trips will be met with the same success.
So why not just roll Trips features into Guides and make one app? Houghton tells TechCrunch Guides is more of a tool, whereas Trips is geared for sharing content.
The app is pretty easy to use; just download, select profiles that suit your interest and scroll through the feed. From there you can pick from a number of the populated stories, many of which will come with maps, photos and some information on tours and things you might want to check out. I was personally checking out Rainbow Mountain in Peru posted about a day ago while scrolling through the app.
You also can hit the discover icon at the bottom of the app, to the right of the home icon, to search for categories like “Adventure” or “Wildlife and Nature.” From there it will lead you to a feed similar to the home feed but with certain trips in mind.
It’s pretty easy to publish your own trips, as well. Like Instagram, you just hit the plus-sign icon at the bottom of the screen. The app will require access to your phone camera and then you’ll be able to add your photos. The app will automatically populate a map of the area and allow you to add content and more info about your trip from there.
The one thing I would say Trips lacks is a search tool. It’s fine to scroll through the places the app provides in the feed, but it’s difficult to look up specific places you are thinking of visiting. If you are like me, you’ll want the ability to look up a place before planning your trip to see what others have to say about it and look at the photos they took.
For those interested in checking it out yourself, Trips is now available for free on iOS and will be available on Android later this year.",2017-08-08,1524370,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-510781237.jpg?w=738,social/,"ios-apps,travel,lonely-planet",Lonely Planet launches an Instagram-like Trips app,instagram,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/lonely-planet-launches-an-instagram-like-trips-app/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"Fintech startup N26 is getting more and more customers. The company reported 300,000 customers back in March. It now has 500,000 customers across Europe.
More importantly, growth seems to be accelerating as the startup announced that it was adding a thousand customers every day back in March. Now, around 1,500 customers sign up every day.
“More than 60 percent of our growth is still organic,” N26 co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf told me.
But it doesn’t mean that N26 is going to stand still. The company plans to ramp up ads and branding efforts. The idea is that getting more customers through ads should also increase organic signups.
In total, N26 users have managed more than $5.9 billion (€5 billion). When you compare it to Revolut, the company currently reports $3.3 billion (Update: $4.3 billion, there was a bug in the reporting tool) in transaction volume with nearly 780,000 customers on its homepage.
Maybe N26 has more active users than Revolut. Maybe Revolut users only use their Revolut card when they’re traveling abroad and not for local purchases.
N26’s main markets are Germany, Austria, France, Spain and Italy. People in dozens of other European countries can also sign up, but they won’t have as many features as German customers.
When you open an N26 account, you get a current account with a MasterCard. You can send and receive money with your German IBAN, and buy things with your card without any foreign transaction fee.
Over time, the startup has added more products to turn N26 into a full-fledged bank. You can save money, invest money, get a loan, control all your insurance contracts and more.
It’s a bit weird to see a bank adding new features as many banks have been standing still for too long.

Natasha Lomas,Apps,"The startup behind the Prisma style transfer app is shifting focus onto the b2b space, building tools for developers that draw on its expertise using neural networks and deep learning technology to power visual effects on mobile devices.
It’s launched a new website, Prismalabs.ai, detailing this new offering.
Initially, say Prisma’s co-founders, they’ll be offering an SDK for developers wanting to add effects like style transfer and selfie lenses to their own apps — likely launching an API mid next week.
Then, in the “next month or so”, they also plan to offer another service for developers wanting help to port their code to mobile. This was, after all, how the co-founders originally came up with the idea for the Prisma app — having seen a style transfer effect working (slowly) on a desktop computer and realized how much potential it would have if it could be made to work in near real-time on mobile.
“The first plan is ready to go solution when you have an idea and want to implement, for example, style transfer or object recognition or something like face masks… or Snapchat lenses,” says CEO and co-founder Alexey Moiseenkov, fleshing out what’s coming from Prisma Labs. “If you need this ability we can offer you a ready to go SDK that you can implement in your app.”
Co-founder Aram Airapetyan gives an example of how their AI-powered image segmentation technology could also be used to allow users of Skype — for example —  to push a button to change or blank out the background during a video call. (Meaning this wouldn’t have to happen, for example.)
The wave of augmented reality apps that are coming down the smartphone pipe, driven by more powerful hardware and active encouragement from mobile platforms, could also help generate demand for Prisma’s effects, reckons Moiseenkov, as they can offer object tracking as well as face tracking via APIs or an SDK.
“The second part [of the b2b offering] is we feel that in a lot of companies developers are struggling with porting technologies to mobile,” he continues. “And we feel that we can offer them our own solution that we use internally — internally we have… a platform that can help us to experiment with our research and producing a lot of demo apps for internal usage and choosing the right one.”
They say they’ve been testing the developer tools with “some very big companies” — but won’t name any names as yet.
“We want to explore the CV [computer vision] area and help companies also produce a greater user experience with AI — helping people to communicate easier, to solve their tasks,” adds Moiseenkov.
“We feel that AI can help a lot of companies to improve the user experience a lot. The camera, working with images, filtering, de-noising, a lot of different stuff can happen — and that’s cool. I feel it can improve the overall quality of apps in App Store and Google Play.”
Prisma’s consumer app shot to painterly popularity last summer, offering smartphone users the ability to transform a standard smartphone photo by quickly and easily applying different graphical styles — to create, for example, a pastiche of a particular artwork or graphical effect.
The app achieved its effects not by applying filters to the photo but by utilizing neural networks and deep learning to process the original photo in the chosen style — generating a new image that combined both input sources.
By December last year, Prisma had racked up around 70 million downloads and earned itself a bunch of app store accolades. But it also attracted the attention of platform giants like Facebook who quickly rolled out style transfer features of their own — helping to cap the app’s momentum.
The team then experimented with adding social elements to the style transfer tool, to see if they could turn Prisma into a social platform in its own right — although, given how dominated the consumer social/messaging space is, by giants like Facebook and WeChat, that always looked like a forlorn hope.
Branching into b2b looks a more solid strategic step for Prisma, positioning the team to offer developers an accelerated route for burnishing the feature-set/UX of their own apps, and selling these b2b services with the help of demonstrable AI-powered visual effects expertise.
So although Prisma is shifting its monetization strategy (likely a usage-based SDK for the visual effects; and maybe a licensing model for the platform, it says), its consumer apps aren’t going away. Indeed, they now double as both testing ground and showcase for what its tech can do for other developers.
“Since the start of this year we were thinking about exploring our opportunities in terms of how to earn money in an efficient way, and we decided to go where we can help companies with computer vision or AI — in terms of more consumer-oriented applications,” Moiseenkov tells TechCrunch.
“We focus on effects; video effects on a mobile camera… We feel this is a really rich area for a company like ours. And also we feel that with our apps in the market we can experiment a lot with different technologies and this pairing can do a lot for us in terms of earning money.”
“We have a very strong R&D team,” adds Airapetyan. “We have lots of guys who are researching and investigating what we can do in terms of different technologies and AI-based products so we’ve been working on these technologies for a while.”
The team launched a second consumer app in July: a sticker-maker called Sticky that uses AI algorithms to perform quick cut-outs of selfies so they can be easily repurposed as colorful stickers.
Across both apps they say they’re getting between 5M to 10M MAUs [monthly active users] and ~500,000 DAUs [daily active users] at this point — with Airapetyan describing their user base as “very stable”.
Prisma’s own team is around 25-strong, split between offices in the Bay Area and Moscow. Though they say they’re also eyeing setting up a base in China — seeing “huge” potential to sell AI-related services in such a large and visually engaged app ecosystem.
The team has previously raised seed funding, although it has never disclosed how much. According to Crunchbase investors in its seed include Gagarin Capital Partners, Haxus and Nikolai Oreshkin. (Notably Haxus was also an investor in Fabby, a computer vision app recently acquired by Google.)
Moiseenkov says Prisma hasn’t raised any funding since the end of last year, and is not currently looking to raise — they want to see how their b2b play plays out first, he adds.
On the competition front for b2b CV/AI tools, he points to a couple of big companies in Asia offering similar services already — such as Face++.  He also name checks Clarifai as another competitor offering image recognition, as well as Google’s image processing APIs — though he claims Google isn’t offering developers a lot of choice vs the plan for Prisma Labs.
“We are working on a very, very wide-range of AI-based technologies,” adds Airapetyan.",2017-08-19,1528433,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-18-08-2017-22-56-40.jpg?w=738,europe/,"visual-effects,style-transfer,ai,prisma",Prisma shifts focus to b2b with an API for AI-powered mobile effects,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/19/prisma-shifts-focus-to-b2b-with-an-api-for-ai-powered-mobile-effects/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"Coup is launching its second city for its electronic scooter-sharing service. You can now find hundreds of Coup scooters in Paris. The company is going to compete with Cityscoot, a similar service that has been around for a while.
While the city’s bike-sharing service has been around for a decade in Paris, scooter-sharing is something new. Coup has acquired around 600 electronic scooters from Gogoro to expand beyond Berlin. Anybody with a driver’s license can now sign up.
When you open the Coup app, you see a map with available scooters around you. You can then book and walk toward your scooter to unlock it using your smartphone. There’s a helmet in the storage space under the seat. After putting the helmet on, you’re good to go.
When you’re done, you don’t have to look for a dedicated parking space for Coup scooters. You can just park your scooter with other regular scooters and lock it for the next user.
Coup can keep an eye on the fleet of scooters as they’re all connected. When the battery level is low, the company can swap the battery for a brand new one. Coup costs €4 for the first 30 minutes and then €1 every ten minutes.
Cityscoot works more or less the same way but costs €0.20 per minute of usage if you buy a pre-paid package. It’s a different pricing strategy. Cityscoot currently has more scooters as well.
But these two services feel somewhat similar. You hunt around your neighborhood to find a scooter, you ride around the city on a silent, electric scooter and then you park it wherever you want when you’re done.
Maybe there’s enough room for two companies on this market. Uber and Chauffeur-Privé seem to be both doing well in Paris for instance. It’s always better to have more options to move around your city, so people living in Paris now have yet another transportation system.",2017-08-17,1528105,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/coup.jpg?w=738,europe/,"france-newsletter,coup",Coup launches new electric scooter service in Paris and faces off with Cityscoot,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/coup-launches-new-electric-scooter-service-in-paris-and-faces-off-with-cityscoot/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Codacy, a startup based in Lisbon, Portugal that offers what it calls an “automated code review platform,” has raised $5.1 million in Series A funding. EQT Ventures led the round, with participation from existing investors Faber, Caixa Capital, Join Capital, and Seedcamp.
Launched in 2014, Codacy says it has been used by hundreds of companies, name-checking Paypal, Adobe, Qlik, Cancer Research UK, and Deliveroo as customers. The software can be installed on-premise or accessed in the cloud and is used by developers to check the quality of code, and implement code quality standards.
“Code review has become an essential part of any development workflow and developers now spend more than 20 per cent of their time reviewing code to catch bugs as early as possible and ensure quality,” says Codacy co-founder Jaime Jorge. “With Codacy, we estimate that we help developers optimise around 30 per cent of their code review time”.
This, claims Jorge, sees engineering teams be more efficient by 6 per cent. Or, put in more tangible terms, can correspond to delivering software two weeks ahead of plan.
“More than code reviews, our mission is to achieve developer productivity through quality at scale. We do this by centralizing the most meaningful problems, alerts and metrics and completely integrating them into your workflow,” he says.
“As an example, as you are creating a pull request we can tell you that we’ve found a security vulnerability as well as tell you that your test coverage is almost at your team’s defined objective. We’re continually developing our product to ensure it’s best-in-class at helping developers understand their code quality and make great engineering decisions”.
Codacy customers range from small digital consultancy shops to large multinational corporations, and span multiple industries and geographies.
Direct competitors are cited as Code Climate, and Sonarqube, but Jorge claims customers choose Codacy because of the way it is integrated into their workflow, to the point of automatically syncing with their favorite tools such as Github Enterprise. “This is particularly useful for our very large customers,” he adds.
Meanwhile, the new round of funding will be used to further build out the team to enable Codacy to expand its offering to a broader base of customers. The company currently employs 13 people and says it is hiring in the areas of software engineering, customer success, sales and marketing.",2017-08-17,1527936,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/codacy-dashboard.png?w=738,europe/,"eqt-ventures,codacy","Codacy, a platform that helps developers check the quality of their code, raises $5.1M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/codacy/
Natasha Lomas,Europe,"Rebooting the venerable Nokia smartphone brand has not been a rush job for HMD Global, the Foxconn-backed company set up for the purpose of licensing the Nokia name to try to revive the brand’s fortunes on smartphones.
But after starting with basic and mid-tier smartphones, it’s finally outted a flagship Android handset, called the Nokia 8, which it will be hoping can put some dents in Samsung’s high end. And/or pull consumers away from Huawei’s flagships handsets — or indeed the swathe of Chinese OEMs surging up the smartphone market share ranks.
With the Nokia 8, HMD is putting its flagship focus on content creators wanting to livestream video for their social feeds.
Competition in the Android OEM space has been fierce for years and there’s no signs of any slack appearing so HDM faces a steep challenge to make any kind of dent here. But at least it now has an iron in the fire. As analyst CCS Insight notes, the handset will be “hugely important in getting Nokia-branded smartphones back on the mobile phone map”.
Specs wise, the Nokia 8 runs the latest version of Android (Nougat 7.1.1) — which HMD is touting as a “pure Android experience”, akin to Google’s Pixel handsets. (There’s a not-so-gentle irony there, given Nokia’s history in smartphones. But clearly HMD is going full in on Android.)
On the hardware front, there’s a top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, plus 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory (expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot). While the 5.3 inch Quad HD resolution display puts it on the verge of phablet territory — and squarely within the current smartphone screen size sweet spot.
Also on board: dual rear cameras, both 13MP (one color, one B&W), and a 13MP front facing lens — all with f/2.0; using Zeiss optics; and with support for 4K video.
The flagship camera feature — and really phone feature too — is the ability to livestream video from both front and back cameras simultaneously.
HMD is trying to coin a hashtaggable word to describe this: “bothie” (as opposed to a selfie)…
This split screen camera feature can also be used for photos — so they’ve basically reinvented Frontback. Well done.
“Content creators can natively broadcast their unique #Bothie stories to social media through the Dual-Sight functionality located within the camera app. Fans can also enjoy unlimited photo [<16MB in size] and video uploads to Google Photos,” HMD writes.
This could prove a sticky feature for social media lovers — perhaps especially the dual video option, which lets people share twin perspective video direct to Facebook and YouTube via the camera app.
Or it could prove a passing fad, like Frontback. Time will tell. CCS Insight describes it as an “interesting approach” but also cautions on whether consumers will take to it.
Commenting on the feature in a statement, HMD’s Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer, said: “We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It’s these people who have inspired us.”
Elsewhere on the device, there’s a spatial surround sound recording tech that uses three microphones and is apparently drawing on Nokia’s Ozo 360 camera division, plus USB type C charging port; a 3.5mm headphone jack; and a non-removable 3090 mAh battery.
The handset, which is clad in an aluminium unibody casing and has a fingerprint reader on the front for device unlocking and authentication, is described as splashproof rather than waterproof.
Global RRP for the Nokia 8 is €599, with a rollout due to start in September. The handset comes in a choice of four colors: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Digi.me and Personal, two companies that broadly play in the personal data space by offering apps to securely store and share various data about yourself, are announcing a merger. Terms of deal remain undisclosed, although I’m told that the combined entity will operate under the Digi.me brand and give the company a 60-person headcount who will operate out of a global HQ near London in the U.K. and a U.S. operation based in Washington, DC.
Personal’s enterprise solution TeamData will be spun off as a separate information security and productivity solution for businesses, while the broader and hugely ambitious vision for the resulting Digi.me remains to become a major player in what founder and Chair Julian Ranger calls the emerging ‘personal data ecosystem’.
The premise, Ranger told me during a call late last week, is that consumers are being enticed to hand over more and more personal data in return for better products and services, but what is still needed is a platform to put you in control of how and who that data is shared with. This needs to be done in a transparent way, and the resulting platform on which companies can build apps on top of should adhere to the principal of informed consent.
Better still, what if your data doesn’t unnecessarily leave your own device or personal cloud storage but can still be shared with businesses on a per use case basis? Nearly 7 years in the making, this is the promise of Digi.me and now combined with Personal.
The way Digi.me works is that the mobile or desktop app asks where in your personal cloud you want your data stored — currently that means Dropbox, with the other usual suspects supported soon — and then it asks you to connect the app to various personal data-points. Right now this means social (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram etc.), with financial and health data currently in various testing phases, including a country-wide ‘living lab’ project with Iceland.
When needed, data stored in your personal cloud is securely processed via your own temporary virtual machine instance sitting on Microsoft’s Azure cloud so that it is normalised and kept up to date, with the local Digi.me app essentially acting as the front end, gatekeeper (including the holder of the needed keys), and distributor for that data.
Then when a third-party app needs access to a particular subset of your data, say your transactions for the last 24 months to do a more accurate credit score, it authenticates via the Digi.me app — meaning that you have to explicitly agree to the specific data request — and the Digi.me app pulls the data from your personal cloud and grants the third-party app access to it.
“Companies and developers can… use Digi.me’s APIs to request access to integrated data sets to provide better data-driven experiences, services, and rewards, and to provide other benefits like rich personal analytics. Health, wearable and music data will also be available soon after the merger,” explains the new joint company.
One crucial point here, however, and what makes the Digi.me proposition different from other approaches to personal data sharing is that the platform has been designed so that in many instances a third-party app can also process the data locally, meaning that it doesn’t need to leave your device. Instead, sticking to the example of a credit score checking app, it only transmits and stores the resulting credit score on its own servers, not the personal financial data it was based on.
That, says Ranger, changes the game completely and should in time mean consumers become comfortable sharing more data in return for new kinds of products and services. “Do more, privately,” is the company’s mantra.
“It isn’t about privacy or sharing, but both privacy and sharing when the point of integration and ownership is the individual,” he says, arguing that this opens up individuals to sharing data that they don’t today such as health, finance, and more.
Likewise, and where Digi.me sees a potentially very large business (since it charges on a per access basis, capped at $3 per user), is that the platform allows any company to have what he quite convincingly argues can be better data than Google et al because it can be wider and deeper and should remain a lot more accurate.
However, for this to become a reality, Ranger concedes it needs two things: Users to find enough utility in Digi.me to download the app and connect it to an increasing number of personal data points, and businesses wanting to develop on the platform, who, in turn, want access to enough users to make it worth their while. The classic platform chicken and egg, you might say.
To address this, Ranger says the app has been designed to be useful first and foremost on an individual and private basis as a way for you to search and get better insights into your own personal data, which benefits from being stored in a single place not multiple silos.
And for businesses who might not see Digi.me as delivering enough users yet — it counts around 400,000 — it has signed a number of partnerships to have those businesses also become a distribution channel for Digi.me. The logic being that a business could offer new functionality in its own app or service that requires a customer to start using Digi.me.
Meanwhile, today’s merger is all about Digi.me having a foothold in North America. As part of that it sees Shane Green, co-founder and CEO of Personal, become CEO of Digi.me’s U.S. operation.
Digi.me and Personal have raised over $40 million combined. Investors include Omidyar Network (the self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” co-founded by eBay founder Pierre Omidya), SwissRe, Planetary Holdings, TCS Capital Management, Allen & Company, Revolution Ventures, Ted Leonsis, and Esther Dyson.

"Contributor,Ingrid Lunden",Apps,"Author note: Abel Owen is Ingrid’s nine-year-old son. These are mostly his words; Ingrid just helped type them a little faster.
I use computers and the Internet all the time and really like them. They are an important part of modern life. And it’s pretty cool to know how they work. So when my mom asked me to help her review some Kano products I was like, “Yes! Let’s do it right now!”
Kano, if you don’t know about it already, is a company that makes interactive coding devices for children (and others) to help them learn more about technology and how computers and other electronic devices work. In the past couple of weeks I have looked at two different Kano devices, the Pixel Kit and the Motion Sensor Kit.
I started off with the Pixel Kit, a hand-held LED light board that launched in July.
It was pretty exciting since I was using an actual machine, using coding to control it. I liked how the whole thing came in parts in the box, and we had to assemble it as part of getting to use it. It reminded me of something my dad and I play with called Snap Circuits.
Then when it’s put together, you link it up with your computer using the Kano app. You create an account and then your kit and computer are connected.
I had used Scratch at school before, which is coding to make video games on a tiny screen. This was a bit cooler since with a Pixel Kit you could create programs (animations, they call them, made either with the Kano’s own coding blocks or JavaScript) that control the Pixel’s 128 LED lights. I liked making light shows that responded to sound: clapping or other loud noises would give you bursts of light. They were awesome (my mom says I can’t keep writing ‘cool’).

I also made games, following the Kano instructions. One was about a hero in search of a treasure. You have to guide the hero towards the treasure.
There was also an accelerometer that you could attach which let you create games where you could tilt the Pixel Kit (it fits in your hand) to move the lights around. Kano has the scripts set up like tasks for you to learn, which helps learn how to do it. I’m pretty sure I could create my own simple games now for the Pixel without the instructions.
A couple of weeks later, we added to our Kano collection with the Motion Sensor Kit. This is a small gesture controller that also works with the Kano app.
You don’t need the Pixel Kit to use it. Like the Pixel, you create scripts on your Kano app. With the Motion Sensor, those scripts let the app respond to your movements as you wave your hand over the motion sensor.
One of the scripts I made was to make a “strumming guitar.” When you waved your hand over the motion sensor as if you were strumming a guitar, on the apps screen you could see guitar strings that moved and made sounds with your movements.
You could also create little pictures that responded to the movements, turtles that spin and snakes that go up and down. And others like this:

As with the Pixel, you can also make games. One that I liked was “Pong,” which made my hand into a table tennis paddle and I played with the computer.
My mom wants me to say also what I didn’t like about both. I think to improve the Pixel Kit, it would be good if there were a wider range of things to do, and maybe a way to fit more than three of your own creations on to your Pixel Kit. That would make it more exciting.
It was also a little fragile, especially since it’s kids using it. One day the battery just disconnected from the ‘brain’ (we had to glue it back). And my mom broke off the power button while trying to glue the battery back, so we had to glue that, too.
(ed. note: We accept this is possibly more our fault than Kano’s. Also, it would have been good to be able to get a Kano app for an iPad or the Google Chromebook Pixel that the family uses rather than a Mac. The Kano products also work with Windows computers and the previously released Kano Computer Kit.)
The Motion Sensor was more sturdy, but it would have been better if it wasn’t tethered to my mom’s Mac.
The Motion Sensor Kit is retailing for $29.99 / £29.99; the Pixel Kit sells for $79.99 / £74.99.
Both can be purchased either directly through the Kano store. In the US, they will soon also be on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Toys R Us, ThinkGeek and Gamestop. In Canada, the product will be available at Indigo, Toys R Us and The Source. In the UK, it will also be on amazon.co.uk.
Kano — co-founded by Alex Klein, Yonatan Raz-Fridman, and Saul Klein — has raised $19 million in funding to date. That includes funding it raised in a Kickstarter campaign that went viral, and a later, more formal venture round for $15 million. Backers include Jim Breyer, Marc Benioff, Martin Sorrell, Index Ventures, James Higa, Troy Carter and Shana Fisher.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"London-based Tail is a new fintech startup that offers a glimpse into the promise of Open Banking. This is seeing upcoming legislation in the EU and U.K. force banks to offer third-party developer access to your bank account data — with your permission, of course.
The app, initially available for iOS and serving London only, offers heavy discounts at local places to eat and drink, all linked to the card you pay with and delivered each week in the form of cashback. However, the draw is how seamlessly it all takes place, by being built on top of digital-only challenger bank Starling‘s API, with Monzo integration also in the works.
This means that it is as simple as granting the Tail app access to your Starling bank account, a one tap process akin to Facebook or Twitter log-in, presuming that you are already a customer of Starling. Once you’ve agreed to a set of permissions — which can be a little daunting the first time, even though they can be easily revoked within the Starling app at any time — any offers that pop up in the Tail app can be redeemed simply by using your Starling MasterCard at the corresponding merchant.
No coupons or receipt scanning or even having to explicitly tell Tail the bank account or card number you want your cashback deposited. And, presumably, once your Starling card has expired (or is lost or stolen), you won’t have to manually link your new card to Tail as it will simply pull the new card info via the challenger bank’s API.
My takeaway: Open Banking is going to be nothing if not convenient, depending on how comfortable you are with granting third-party apps access to your banking data.
“Tail is turning open banking APIs into an offer platform, thereby eliminating all friction points for retailers and consumers which are still inherent in today’s solutions,” Tail founder and CEO Philipp Keller, who was previously at Morgan Stanley, tells me.
“Using Tail, consumers can browse through a selection of curated offers, which are pre-linked to their bank card, eliminating the need for physical vouchers or coupon codes. The offer feed is updated in real-time and location specific. Redemption happens in-app, allowing for a more discreet way of redeeming offers, and accumulated savings are distributed back to the user in the form of cash back paid out in regular intervals”.
Meanwhile, along with making it super convenient for customers to discover and redeem offers, the Tail CEO reckons it is addressing a number of merchant pain points too, and thus opening up this kind of offers platform to smaller independents right down to the Long Tail.
“There’s no EPOS integration or codes required, no staff involvement whatsoever, they don’t have to download an app and we track the redemption stats for them,” he says. “The retailer provides card details and tells us what type of campaign she wants to run, the discount and the applicable times”.
In addition, new tools, such as real-time flash campaigns or “sequenced offers,” help to address specific issues such as spare capacity utilisation and new customer acquisition more effectively.
Flash campaigns that are simple to run via Tail could include a merchant offering 50 per cent off on a rainy day, or putting up an offer for the next 30 minutes during an unexpected lull in footfall. And by “sequenced offers,” Keller is referring to ways of enticing first time customers to become repeat customers, such as different discounts depending on if it is a first, second or third visit to a particular restaurant.
“We’re looking to turn this into a self-serve platform at some point. At that point it will be even easier; just insert campaign type (first-time customers, off-peak hours, etc) and enter card details,” he adds.",2017-08-14,1526655,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tailapp-1.jpg?w=738,europe/,"monzo,starling",London fintech Tail is a cashback platform built on the promise of Open Banking,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/tail-at/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"If you don’t care too much about loyalty programs, chances are that you’ve been relying on platforms like Booking.com and Expedia to find the cheapest flights and hotel rooms. Moneytis wants to do the exact same thing, but for foreign exchange services.
TransferWise is arguably the biggest consumer brand in international transfers. Instead of telling your bank to send money to your bank account, you send money to TransferWise first. The startup then converts the amount and transfers your money to the other account abroad.
It’s been an eye-opening experience for many consumers who realized that they’re getting screwed by banks, Western Union, Moneygram, etc.
But TransferWise is just one player in this space. For instance, while the startup is usually quite competitive when you want to convert GBP into EUR, it’s not as competitive when you want to send money from the U.S. to Europe. Other services, such as CurrencyFair let you keep more money at the end of your transfer.
That’s why Moneytis is applying the Booking.com model to international transfers. The experience is quite straightforward as you just have to put two different currencies and how much money you plan on sending.
“I was an expat in China and Etienne [Tatur] was in Europe. And I was shocked by hidden fees every time I wanted to send money,” co-founder and CFO Christophe Lassuyt told me. “That’s when we listed and compared all solutions out there. Friends quickly asked us to see the list. We ended up launching a comparison tool. We then understood that users wanted to compare, but also transfer easily. That’s the service we’re launching.”
Moneytis then compares many services and displays the fastest service, the cheapest one, the most popular one, etc. You don’t have to sign up to other services as you can send your money directly on Moneytis.
The startup doesn’t add any fee. Instead, Moneytis takes a small cut from third-party services as it is generating leads for those foreign exchange services. On average, clients are sending $2,000 — Moneytis takes 0.3 percent (representing $6) and it’s transparent for the user.
There’s no clear winner in the foreign exchange space as big players like TransferWise only cover some currencies. Exchange rate volatility also means that some services are going to be cheaper one day and more expensive the next day. Finally, some services will be able to get better deals for particular routes.
Moneytis is clearly a volume play as the startup will need thousands of transfers per day to scale. It could build an API so that big clients can automate transfers and always use the cheapest service out there. This way, the service could become an essential tool for companies doing business in many different countries.

Romain Dillet,Apps,"Ulysses is one of the most popular apps for writers. It lets you write, edit, organize, sync and export all your writing in a single, unified interface. That’s why it’s interesting to see that it is switching to a subscription-only business model.
I’ve already written about Ulysses a few times. It’s a rock-solid, well-designed writing app for iOS and macOS. It relies on Markdown formatting and lets your export your writing to WordPress and Medium — among other things.
Ulysses is the exact same app on iOS and macOS, proving that you can make professional apps for the iPhone and the iPad. The company behind it won an Apple Design Award at WWDC. It used to cost $45 on the Mac and $25 on iOS.
While the company released a free macOS trial on its website, there was no easy way to let you try the app on your iPhone or iPad. Additionally, it was a bit confusing that you had to buy the same app twice so that you could use it on all your devices. But if you were a serious writer and you were willing to spend $60 on two apps, Ulysses could become your writing studio.
Yesterday, the company announced that it would drop upfront purchases altogether. If you want to use Ulysses, you can now download the app on iOS and macOS to start a 14-day free trial. After that, you have to pay $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. There’s a $10 discount on the annual subscription if you were a previous Ulysses user, and students are also eligible to a special subscription of $11.99 per six months.
And it turns out that people care a lot about subscriptions. While hundreds of millions of people pay a subscription to access Spotify, Netflix and other content services, making people pay for apps is still unpopular.
Max Seelemann wrote a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind subscription pricing. As a customer, I’m more than happy to see that subscriptions are going to make Ulysses more sustainable.
According to Ulysses’ website, there are a dozen people working on Ulysses. I looked back at my purchasing history. I was an early Ulysses buyer so I ended up paying less than the full price for both apps. I paid $20 for the Mac app 4 years and a half ago and $20 for the iOS app 18 months ago.
There’s no way you can build a successful business with customers that pay $40 over the course of four years and a half. Your local coffee shop probably has a higher customer lifetime value while hiring fewer people.
Software giants, such as Adobe and Microsoft, have successfully switched to subscriptions. The majority of customers and companies pay a monthly fee to access Photoshop, Microsoft Word and other productivity apps.
But most small software companies still rely on upfront purchases and regular paid upgrades. That’s why many apps end up being neglected or stop working after a major operating system update. Let’s see if Ulysses can reverse the trend.",2017-08-11,1526107,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ulysses-5.jpeg?w=738,europe/,ulysses,Popular writing app Ulysses switches to subscription model,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/popular-writing-app-ulysses-switches-to-subscription-model/
Anthony Ha,Europe,"LaterPay is offering media companies a business model that goes beyond subscriptions and ads.
Cosmin Ene, the German startup’s founder and CEO, argued that while some publications are having success with paywalls and online subscriptions, it’s an approach that only convinces the most loyal readers to pay.
So LaterPay is trying to help monetize “the vast space” between subscriptions and ads, allowing publishers to charge for their content on an à la carte basis. That can mean charging per article or video, or asking users to buy a pass to their site for a limited period of time.
Ene knows that might sound depressingly similar to the micropayment models that have fallen flat, despite the hype that they might save journalism. In fact, he recalled being told by an investor, “Micropayments don’t work on the internet.”
Ene’s response was to point to the sushi dinner that they were eating. If they had to pay for each plate of sushi before they ate it, or if they had to pay “100 bucks before we see the menu,” well, that would be a crummy dining experience. Instead, they ordered the food they wanted and then paid the bill at the end.
Similarly, Ene said most micropayment platforms asked users to pay upfront, before they’ve read anything, or when they first hit a paywalled article.
LaterPay, meanwhile, is supposed to make the payment process as frictionless as possible. Users don’t even have to enter any payment information when they buy their first piece of content — they don’t have to make a purchase at all until their bill reaches $5. As a result, the company says that 78 percent of article purchases made through the LaterPay platform take 10 seconds or less.
Switching food metaphors, Ene added, “The vast amount of occasional users just want to buy a glass of milk, but not the whole cow.”
LaterPay has already signed up some big customers in Germany, including Der Spiegel.
Now it’s launching in the United States. To fund these efforts, it’s raised an additional 5 million euros (bringing the company’s total funding to 20 million euros). And its U.S. expansion will be led by Hal Bailey (formerly director of emerging business development at Google), who’s been brought on as the company’s new chief revenue officer.
Update: Asked about the investors in the new funding, LaterPay said the money comes from “private investors from Switzerland and Germany, with industry experience in finance and technology.”",2017-08-10,1525865,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/mobile-payment-transfer.png?w=738,europe/,"micropayments,laterpay",LaterPay brings its media payment technology to the US,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/laterpay-us-launch/

The Glint website describes the startup as “a new global currency, account and app” and says it will make your money “reliable and independent” and give you more control in the way you “store, spend, exchange and transfer money”. If that all sounds a bit vague —
aside from alluding to a new (and more) stable currency tied to a payments app — it’s probably intended to be. The company isn’t pegged to launch until the last quarter of this year.
However, I understand that Glint will offer a frictionless way to both store and spend your money in gold, including at the point of sale, just like a regular local currency. The bigger picture is that gold historically has been a better storage of value than any government-created currency, and therefore — with the aid of technology — is (arguably) a good candidate for an alternative global currency. The startup has already been authorised and is regulated by the U.K.’s FCA, under, presumably, an Electronic Money Institution license.
Meanwhile, Glint’s founders both know a thing or two about gold.
CEO Jason Cozens co-founded GoldMadeSimple.com, a website that helps clients buy and sell physical gold and have it stored securely or delivered. He also previously founded two other companies: Visuality — where he is said to have pioneered Virtual Reality, e-commerce and online marketing, selling to ERP software company McGuffie Brunton — and Bite, a digital marketing agency.
Glint COO Ben Davies is said to have over 17 years’ experience within international financial and commodity markets. He was the former head of trading at RBS Greenwich, and co-founded Hinde Capital in 2007, an alternative investment management company specialising in precious metals.",2017-08-10,1525045,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/2dsc_0651-1.jpg?w=738,europe/,glint,Glint is a stealthy London fintech startup that promises to turn gold into a ‘new global currency’,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/glint/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Jinn, the U.K.-based same-hour ‘shop on your behalf’ delivery app that operates quite similarly to Postmates in the U.S., has gone through a turbulent time of late. This saw the company withdraw from all markets outside of London last month, as part of several rounds of mass-layoffs. Operations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds in the U.K., and Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, have been “paused” indefinitely.
The aim, Jinn founder Mario Navarro said at the time, was to continue on a “path towards profitability” by focussing solely on the U.K. capital city, which accounted for 90 per cent of its orders. And now the startup is claiming to have done just that: “Jinn is profitable at an EBITDA level, with 30% contribution margins, and expecting to close the year with $22M in sales,” says the company.
Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that Jinn co-founder and COO Leon Herrera departed the startup two months ago and has relocated back to his home country of Spain. In a call, Navarro said he couldn’t comment directly on Herrera’s reasons for leaving, except to say they weren’t work-related and that the two remain on good terms and that Herrera is still a Jinn shareholder and supporter of the startup.
“I can confirm that today we are profitable at an EBITDA level,” Navarro tells me. “And that we will be EBITDA profitable in August and for the coming months”. In other words — contrary to a lot of speculation — there is life in Jinn yet.
He also says the startup has managed to automate the entire platform, meaning that it is able to handle both partner orders and non-partner orders in a much less labour intensive fashion in terms of how those orders are processed, which in turn has helped to bring down costs. The startup is also disclosing that headcount sits at a very lean 20 staff members, down from a reported high of around 100, though Navarro wouldn’t confirm that figure.
In May this year, the company announced that it had raised $10 million in further funding, capital it planned to use to continue to grow and “consolidate its presence in its main markets”. However, as I’ve noted before, it is far from clear if Jinn’s latest round was based on tranches or contingent on certain milestones or KPIs being met. In other words, it is unlikely Jinn has burned through that cash or that it all entered the company’s balance sheet in the first place. Navarro declined to comment.
“Jinn is now running a lean and efficient operation with 20 people, and has returned to its true start up roots: empowering employees to get involved in all areas of the business, innovating every day to solve problems and most importantly, getting ready for the challenge of growing the business sustainably,” says the company in a statement.
Jinn says it currently has 1,000 monthly active couriers on the platform, 1,000 partners and over 100,000 customers. It expects to double its current monthly completed orders in the next four months.
Adds Navarro in a statement: “The departure of some of our amazing employees and close friends has been the most painful part of this decision. Working alongside them has been a privilege and we can’t be thankful enough for all the effort and the commitment they’ve put into the company. We’ve been completely humbled by their understanding of the situation and their willingness to continue supporting Jinn in any way possible. If you’re looking for amazing talent, please write to me at mario@jinnapp.com”.",2017-08-09,1525102,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/photo_2015-10-23_18-18-12.jpg?w=738,europe/,jinn,"After heavy restructuring, London on-demand delivery app Jinn claims to be ‘profitable’",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/jinn-profitable/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Railsbank, a relatively new fintech startup co-founded by CEO Nigel Verdon, who previously founded money exchange and payments platform Currencycloud, has raised $1.2 million in a funding round led by seed investment firm Firestartr.
The company, yet to see its full launch and over a year in the making, offers what it describes as an open banking and compliance platform aimed at other companies, including other fintechs, that have global banking requirements that need to be accessed programatically via an API.
Other backers in this round include Kima Ventures and a number of notable angel investors such as Peter Jackson (CEO WorldPay U.K.), Tim Levene (Betfair, Augmentum Capital) and Phillip Riese (former Chairman of Zopa).
It follows an earlier angel investment in September last year, including from the former head of Google Wallet in Europe who, I’m told, wanted something akin to Railsbank when he was running Google Wallet. That’s because the unnamed bank Google Wallet ran on top of could not easily deliver on the promise of pan-European banking via an API.
“The problem with accessing global or regional wholesale transaction banking services from traditional suppliers (e.g. HSBC, Citi, BAML, Deutsche etc.) is that it takes 3-9 months to open each bank account, up to 9 months to technically connect (as each API is bespoke to the customer) and customers have to sink vast Capex expenditure to make this happen, before a single transaction is done. That is if the bank will even bank you!” Verdon tells me.
The main issues behind this holdup and expense is legacy technology that most incumbent banks run on, and the thorny issue of compliance. The latter means that friction isn’t just caused by technology alone but the need to comply with the law and cumbersome systems in place to ensure global banking does so. “Neither are changing anytime soon,” teases Verdon.
It is here — at the intersection of technology and compliance, and by using technology to scale compliance — that Verdon and Railsbank’s other founder Clive Mitchell, who is also a fintech veteran, see an opportunity. The resulting banking and compliance platform connects together a global network of partner banks for companies who want API access to global banking. “Access to global transaction banking with 5 lines of code,” akin to something like Stripe for banking, is the Railsbank mantra.
Specifically, the platform provides companies with a range of wholesale banking services, including IBANs, receiving money, sending money, converting money, direct debit, issuing cards, and managing credit through APIs. “Our tech solves the legacy issue by hiding it,” explains Verdon.
However, along with the Railsbank CEO’s insistence internally that its API should be considered its UX — since developers are the startup’s end user — the secret sauce is that compliance has been baked in from the start. This sees all transactions that are initiated through the platform stay in line with compliance policy enforced through what Railsbank calls its unique “Compliance Firewall”.
“For the first time the partner and/or customer’s compliance manual is live and active and not a PDF stuck in a drawer,” claims Verdon. “Every transaction (on-boarding, opening an account, receiving money, sending money, issuing a card, issuing credit etc.) has to pass through the Compliance Firewall and has to comply with compliance policy”.
To that end, the types of companies or fintech startups that could utilise Railsbank are far-ranging and Verdon says that every day the company is discovering new use-cases. (It offers a sandbox, including live account generation, to try out the platform.)
One example is a regulated investment company that needs modern API access to its banking. This could include creating accounts, receiving money, sending money etc, so that they can implement straight through processing.
Another is a lender that wants to offer a ‘banking lite’ current account to gain more data on an individual customer’s behaviour to lower the lending risk and possibly even the lending rates.
Or perhaps an Amazon merchant who wants to sell on Amazon’s European stores but needs to demonstrate compliance controls to a banking partner. They could use Railsbank to show they only accept money from Amazon including surfacing Amazon Marketplace data (via Amazon’s API) on what goods were sold for each Amazon settlement.",2017-08-09,1524683,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/nigel-verdon-railsbank-hi-res.jpg?w=738,europe/,"nigel-verdon,currencycloud,firestartr","Railsbank, a new fintech startup from founder of Currencycloud, raises $1.2M led by Firestartr",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/railsbank/
Jon Russell,Asia,"SoftBank has been heavily linked with an investment in Uber in recent weeks, and today CEO Masayoshi Son confirmed his interest in pursuing a deal. However, in a twist, Son said that SoftBank is also considering buying into Uber’s arch-enemy in the U.S., Lyft, instead.
Speaking to investors following the announcement of SoftBank’s Q1 2017 earnings, Son was candid about SoftBank’s desire to back a horse in the U.S. ride-sharing space. While it is the largest investor in Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and 99 (Latin America), it doesn’t yet have representation in North America.
“We are interested in discussing with Uber, [but] we are also interested in discussing with Lyft,” Son said during a Q&A session. “We haven’t decided which way, but [the] U.S. is a very big market — it’s [the] most important market — so we are definitely very much interested in the U.S. market. Whether we decide to partner and invest into Uber or Lyft, I don’t know what will be the end result.”
Lyft recently hit one million rides per day, and its valuation is rising while Uber goes through a period of uncertainty without a CEO, but still its business is considerably smaller than Uber. Lyft closed $600 million in fresh funding at a $7.5 billion valuation in April, whereas Uber has been valued at over $60 billion. Its value is less certain now. Reports indicate, however, that SoftBank may do business at a lower valuation, and involve secondary share sales.
For all that talk it doesn’t appear that any kind of deal is on the table right now. Son himself said SoftBank is “exploring the idea and we would like to discuss with both companies.”
The idea of investing in Uber, which rivals Ola, Grab and 99 but was beaten by Didi in China, has surprised many, but throw in the fact that SoftBank is also weighing its rival and there’s likely to be further confusion over the motivation. However, Son explained that he sees ride-sharing as a key global industry that Softbank can ill-afford to miss out on.
“This is the shared economy and one of the most important industries, I think the way people use the transportation and the lifestyle will be different from today [compared to in] 30 years [or] 50 years,” he explained.
“The autonomous car is definitely coming, and when that stage comes, this ride-share business becomes even more important,” Son added.
SoftBank’s ride-sharing ambition — which has been clear for some time — sits outside of its enormous Vision Fund, which is targeting a $100 billion total raise and also has stakes in huge global companies like ARM and Nvidia.
SoftBank announced a first close of $93 billion for the fund in May, but revealed it will sit out ride-sharing deals due to conflicts of interest. That hasn’t stopped SoftBank from stepping up and financing billion-dollar funding rounds for Grab and Didi already this year, with other companies likely to be on the receiving end of additional financing.",2017-08-07,1524047,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screenshot-2017-08-07-16-03-07.png?w=738,asia/,softbank,SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son says he wants to invest in either Uber or Lyft,"uber,lyft",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/softbank-lyft-uber/
Connie Loizos,Asia,"Less than two weeks ago, WeWork took the wraps off a new massive round of funding — $500 million from the Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital, the Japanese internet giant SoftBank, Greenland Holdings, and China Oceanwide.
Now, the company is announcing that it’s pouring that exact amount — $500 million — into expanding into Southeast Asia and Korea. Interestingly, it says this $500 million is new and not the same capital, though it isn’t disclosing from where the money is coming.
As part of its announcement, WeWork says it has spent an undisclosed amount to acquire a 1.5-year-old, Singapore-based co-working company Spacemob. Spacemob’s founder and CEO, Turochas Fuad, will become managing director of Southeast Asia for WeWork. Spacemob’s roughly 20 employees will also join WeWork.
SpaceMob had raised just $5.5 million in seed funding from Alpha JWC Ventures and Vertex Ventures in November of last year. Rather than a big, splashy acquisition, it more or less represents the same, promising but smaller scale business that WeWork has acquired in the past.
WeWork’s few previous acquisitions to date include Fieldlens, a mobile communication system for the construction industry that WeWork bought in June; Welkio, a digital sign-in system for guests at an office that it purchased last year; and Case, a building information modeling and consultancy firm that WeWork acquired in 2015. WeWork hasn’t disclosed financial terms for any of these deals.
The amount of money that WeWork has raised this year is astonishing. In addition to the $1 billion it has announced in the last two weeks, a Delaware filing had surfaced in June, showing that WeWork had closed on $760 million in separate funding. WeWork also raised $300 million in March.
The company was reportedly valued at $20 billion as of two weeks ago. It isn’t clear whether its newest capital injection changes that number.
Given the fractured but growing competition that WeWork is facing in these newer markets, its aggressive push isn’t surprising. Just last month, URWork, a two-year-old, Beijing-based co-working business in China modeled largely WeWork, raised $30 million in fresh funding that brings its total funding to date to $175 million altogether.
It’s also in a race with Naked Hub, a company that started out in resorts and has moved into co-working across China to become a key rival. Naked Hub recently moved into Southeast Asia with an acquisition of its own, and it is raising $200 million for growth.
WeWork already has locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Bangalore. Zeroing in on Singapore also makes sense given the sky-high rates that startups must pay for offices, which rank among the highest in the world.
The company’s newest $500 million round is just the latest of three significant rounds it has raised so far in 2017. In June, a Delaware filing surfaced that showed WeWork had closed on $760 million in new funding in June. WeWork had also raised $300 million in March. The company is now valued at $20 billion.
In addition to SoftBank, Hony Capital, Greenland Holdings, and China Oceanwide, WeWork’s investors include Benchmark, Aleph, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Legend Holdings, T. Rowe Price, and Wellington Management, among others.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Uber is in the spotlight for shady operations once again after a report revealed that the U.S. ride-hailing giant knowingly leased cars that were subject to a recall to drivers in Singapore.
A Wall Street Journal report exposed the events which took place in 2016 and centered around the Honda Vezel, one of a number of vehicles that Uber purchased and then made available for drivers to lease in Singapore, where the cost of a car is among the highest on the planet. Honda issued on a recall on the model due to faulty part, but Uber continued to buy affected models and lease them to drivers without first fixing the issue. In one case, an Uber car caught fire but fortunately neither the driver nor any passengers were in it at the time, the Journal reported.
Central to the problem, Uber opted to buy its cars from auto importers rather than licensed dealers once it had exhausted local used-car dealer supplies, a move that the Journal said was made to save on spending. Uber’s importers, which operate in a legal grey area, didn’t fix the affected Vezel vehicles due to an apparent shortage of parts and Honda wasn’t obligated to do so, but Uber kept the vehicles on the road while it waited in order to avoid a negative reaction.
The Journal said one senior Uber Singapore executive described a possible recall, which would have left affected drivers without their vehicle since there was no immediate fix, as an event that would “send panic alarm bells to the mass market.”
Eventually, Uber did request drivers of affected Vezels to take their vehicle to a repair shop to get the faulty part deactivated, a move that it believed would reduce the potential for danger but one that was not approved by Honda itself. The Journal said Uber informed drivers of the need for “immediate precautionary servicing,” but a website containing information did not mention the dangers of overheating and fire which triggered the recall from Honda.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Xiaomi’s good run has continued after a research firm found that the Chinese firm has ranked top for sales of wearable devices worldwide for the first. Sales of Fitbit devices, meanwhile, plunged by 40 percent
Coming off the back of Xiaomi’s reentry into the world’s top five smartphone sellers, a new Strategy Analytics report found that it leapfrogged Apple and Fitbit to become the top seller of wearables in Q2 2017 with 3.7 million units shipped. Fitbit logged 3.4 million shipments during the quarter with Apple coming in at 2.8 million —  the U.S. firm actually posted higher sales growth than Xiaomi. The rest of the field was responsible for a further 11.7 million units, or 54 percent of all wearables shipped during the quarter.
Xiaomi and Apple both grew their marketshare year-on-year (from 15 percent to 17 percent, and nine percent to 13 percent, respectively), but Fitbit’s share cratered from 29 percent to 16 percent.
Both Xiaomi and Apple take very different approaches to wearables. Xiaomi has a wide range of products that are priced competitively and feature heart-rate monitors and alerts — the Mi Band is priced as low as $14.99 in the U.S. — while the Apple Watch, at upwards of $269, is a more premium approach that’s packed with a fuller set of features. While they both stand for something at different ends of the market, Fitbit’s position is less certain.
“Fitbit is at risk of being trapped in a pincer movement between the low-end fitness bands sold by Xiaomi and the fitness-led, high-end smartwatches sold by Apple,” Strategy Analytics’ Neil Mawston said in a statement.

As for the other two, Strategy Analytics said reports that the next Apple Watch may include extended health tracking capabilities could help Apple reclaim the top spot. But for now its lack of health band options is what the firm believes is keeping Xiaomi ahead, the firm concluded.
Xiaomi has had a resurgent 2017 so far, bouncing back from two disappointing years in which it struggled to maintain once-explosive growth and missed sales targets. A push into offline retail in China and progress in India, where the company cracked $1 billion in revenue last year, have contributed to a more optimistic outlook this year, with CEO Lei Jun claiming it has reached “a major inflection point in its growth.”
The company said its phone sales were up 70 percent quarter-on-quarter in Q2 with 23 million sold in Q2. Now it is pushing on with its offline retail strategy and furthering its global expansion plan thanks to a $1 billion loan that was secured last month.",2017-08-03,1523031,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/xiaomi8.jpg?w=738,asia/,"home-automation,technology,wearable-devices,computing",Report: Xiaomi is world’s top wearable maker for first time as Fitbit sales slide,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/report-xiaomi-is-worlds-top-wearable-maker-for-first-time-as-fitbit-sales-slide/
Jon Russell,Asia,"China’s Ofo and Mobike may be the Uber of bike-sharing thanks an early head start and more than $1 billion in cumulative funding that’s financing aggressive international expansions, but that isn’t deterring smaller players.
Hong Kong’s Gobee Bike, one such upstart — which literally operates in the shadow of those two Chinese giants — just announced a $9 million Series A round aimed at expanding its six-month-old dock-less bike rental service overseas.
The round was provided by Grishin Robotics, an internet-of-things fund led by Mail.Ru co-founder Dmitry Grishin, with participation from Alibaba’s Hong Kong entrepreneurship fund. Gobee previously raised a pre-launch seed round led by Swiss Founders Fund.
The service is much like Ofo, Mobike, Obike and others in that it provides bicycles which are rented via a smartphone app that scans the bike’s QR code to unlock it. Each one contains a GPS chip which means it can be dropped off at and rented from any location.
Gobee was founded in February by Raphael Cohen (CEO) and Claude Ducharme (CTO), before going live in Hong Kong in April with a few initial hiccups. Cohen, who co-founded Hotel Quickly and was formerly with Rocket Internet’s FoodPanda business, said it has accrued over 100,000 downloads to date and currently offers “thousands” of bikes.
Describing Hong Kong as its “proof of concept” market, Cohen said the plan is to expand the service into North America, Europe and other parts of Asia. He didn’t provide specific details of expansion markets, but said that Gobee already has people on ground in “several” global cities. Gobee is likely to be in the market to raise more funding to realize that globalization push soon, Cohen admitted.
Ofo and Mobike are both aggressively looking to move their businesses outside of China. Both are targeting 100 cities worldwide before the year is out, and have already hit the UK and Singapore as initial forays into new territories gets underway.
Cohen admitted that the colossal size of these rivals is a concern for Gobee, but he believes that they have bitten off more than they can chew. His theory is that the sheer scale of their ambition — and the importance of the Chinese market — will leave the door open for nimble players to pick up the bike-sharing baton in places like Europe and North America.
“They are very focused on China, which is the world’s biggest market for bike-sharing, but they have a lot still to do there with only about 10-20 percent of the market potential unlocked,” he said. “But it seems like they not putting as much attention as they should. As has happened with other Chinese companies, they start expanding abroad and lose their focus on China, where new players came in and took marketshare.”
Gobee isn’t looking to make a move on China, but it is betting that the big players will ultimately divert their attention back to their homeland, leaving their global expansions deprioritized and weakened.
That’s quite a risk given the backing that Ofo and Mobike have received, in terms of sheer financial numbers and major tech names, but Gobee’s global push is also contingent on overseas markets taking to bike-sharing. Cohen said his experiences in Hong Kong leave him in no doubt, but it’s too early to say whether Mobike and Ofo’s overseas launches, which included vandalism and other issues in Manchester, will prove successful.",2017-08-03,1523003,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gobee-2.jpg?w=738,asia/,"ofo,mobike,transport,bicycle-sharing",Hong Kong’s Gobee raises $9M to take on China’s bike-sharing unicorns worldwide,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/hong-kongs-gobee-raises-9m/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Yinglan Tan, a Sequoia venture partner based out of Singapore, has left the firm following a five-year stint and is now launching his own fund. Both Tan and Sequoia confirmed that he departed earlier this year.
Tan, who joined Sequoia in 2012 from Singapore’s National Research Fund and is the author of two books on tech and investment, was part of Sequoia’s presence in Southeast Asia. 
Now, however, is he focused on his own firm which is called Insignia Venture Partners, according to his LinkedIn profile. E27 reported that the firm is near to closing its maiden fund, but Tan declined to comment on the specifics when we asked.
“I enjoyed my time at Sequoia greatly. I finally have some down time to pursue my interest to holiday in Southeast Asia and spend more time with my kids. More importantly, I have got some time to shape my thinking. I am starting to crystallise my thoughts for Southeast Asia,” he said.
“The startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia is booming and now is the right time to do something. I am hatching my plans, but nothing concrete yet. Give me some time and stay tuned,” Tan added.
Sequoia is one of the few investment funds that operates in the Series A and Series B spaces in Southeast Asia. Despite that and growing interest in the region from major tech companies, with recent deals from Alibaba, Tencent, SoftBank and Expedia, it doesn’t have a dedicated fund. Instead, its Southeast Asia deals are covered by the Sequoia India fund. The current India fund, the firm’s fourth, is the country’s largest VC fund with a total corpus of over $850 million.
Earlier this summer, Sequoia secured $4 billion in fresh financing, including $2 billion for its growth funds, according to a U.S. filing. The firm decline to provide details on how the capital will be allocated, but a good bet is that a large chunk will be put to work in Asia. Indeed, according to report, $125 million of that fresh allocation was funneled into the current India fund.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Less than 24 hours after a leak seemingly confirmed that Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Note 8 will pack a gigantic screen, LG has confirmed long-standing rumors that its next smartphone will feature an OLED screen.
The Korean firm detailed some details of its next device, believed to be the V30, including its “plastic OLED FullVision display.” The six-inch screen will be the largest on a phone that LG has released for four years, the company said, but the actual device will be smaller than last year’s V20.
Why go with an OLED?
Well, screens are becoming a battleground for this year’s flagship smartphones, with the next iPhone rumored to be packing one. LG said it is keen to dip into its experience in screens — which has propelled its TV business — to enable virtual reality and other content-led services on mobile. It aims to do that with a 1,440 x 2,880 resolution display which, despite being plastic, is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 and tech that mitigates past issues with OLEDs, such as burn-in, aka “ghost” images that are visible even when a screen is off.
This won’t be the first time LG has adopted an OLED — it put one into the experimental G Flex 2 released two years ago, but now the tech is stepping up to a prominent role. That makes sense given that LG just invested $7 billion into its OLED production capabilities.

Jon Russell,Asia,"Asian streaming company M17 Entertainment, which recently merged with Singapore-based dating startup Paktor, has closed a $40 million Series A round.
This new funding will be used to increase M17’s roster of streaming talent — the company agrees contracts with its streamers and celebs, much like a talent agency — and expand into new genres, such as reality TV, variety shows and music, the company said. M17 will also launch its service in new markets in Asia.
Taiwan-based M17 claims to have 30 million users while it counted over 50,000 streamers — aka content producers — as of April. Its streaming service is currently available in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, but it currently includes only streamers from Taiwan. TechCrunch understands the plan is to open it up to streamers based in Japan, Hong Kong and Indonesia in the near future. China is another target, despite intense competition from well-funded rivals and government regulation.
Beyond the money, it has inked a partnership with KKBOX Group, which operates Asia-focused music/video streaming services and a talent agency. The idea is to help promote new talent, while leaning on the group’s media to give M17 streamers further exposure.
“KKBOX Group will work with M17 Entertainment to invest in original content creators. The content will be broadcasted on KKBOX’s media channels. We will also assist in music production, lending more exposure to music talents as well as giving them a chance to fulfill their aspirations as a singer,” KKBOX founder Chris Lin said in a statement.
The round was led by existing investor Infinity Venture Partners from Japan, with other existing backers Vertex Ventures, Yahoo Japan, and Majuven. New investors Golden Summit Capital and Korea’s KTB Ventures joined, too.
Thanks to the merger deal, M17 has quite a complicated cap table. M17 had previously raised $33 million from investors, while Paktor, which operates Tinder-like dating apps in Asia and across other global markets, took in over $75 million.
M17 CEO Joseph Phua told TechCrunch in April — the time of the merger — that the company was on track to gross $100 million in annual revenue with streaming a major contributor. There’s no update on that figure for now.
While live-streaming is a feature for the likes of Facebook and Twitter in the West, it has developed into a very promising and lucrative industry of its own in Asia. Chinese companies such as Momo, which started in dating but is raking in money from live-streaming, and Kuaishou, which recently raised $350 million led by Tencent, have blazed the path that M17 seems to be following.
The company looks like it is dipping into that Chinese live-streaming playbook for the rest of Asia, but it is up against competitors. The prominent rival is Bigo Live, which has dominated the genre in Southeast Asia. It has raised $180 million from investors to date, including major financing from asset management firm Ping An at a $400 million valuation.

Jon Russell,Apps,"WhatsApp is about to get an unlikely competitor in India, its largest global market based on users. That’s because Paytm, the $8 billion-valued company behind the country’s top digital wallet, is in the process of expanding its services into person-to-person communication, games and other mobile content.
The planned update, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will go live in a beta feature that will ship to users before the end of August, a source with knowledge of the plans told TechCrunch.
Paytm declined to comment.
The Paytm app will start out mimicking WhatsApp with chat app features including text, image, video and audio messaging, but it plans to go beyond the basics to integrate more sophisticated features. The model is something along the lines of WeChat in China, which today covers media, payments, ride-hailing, commerce and much more.
Once the initial messaging beta version is live, Paytm will begin working to include WeChat-like communications channels, which are essentially official accounts that allow brands to connect with users, and mobile games and other content. That could allow brands and Paytm merchants to market goods directly to users, and receive digital payment for them without the need for a face-to-face interaction.
This mobile push goes some way to explaining the recent joint venture that the India company created with Alibaba affiliate AGTech Media.
What’s particularly interesting about Paytm’s mobile strategy is that parent company One97 Communication has a history in this space. It started out producing mobile content before it unearthed a mobile payments business and span it out. Another factor: Paytm’s largest shareholder is Alibaba is keen on exploring messaging after it totally missed the opportumity in China. Today its rival Tencent dominates the space with WeChat, which is encroaching on Alibaba’s core payment and commerce businesses.
Alibaba has tried to integrate social features into its Alipay service, China’s dominant digital payment app, but with little to no success to date. You can be sure that the Chinese company has had influence on shaping Paytm’s move into messaging.
Now comes the significance part. Paytm currently claims 230 million registered users. While most media have reported that this is larger than WhatsApp’s 200 million monthly users in India, it isn’t since Paytm’s active userbase stands at 54 million as of July, according to the source.
Nonetheless, there’s a clear crossover here with WhatsApp. The Facebook-owned company is widely believed to have selected India as the market where it will integrate mobile payments — reportedly using the government’s payment system — which would see it tread on Paytm’s turf, although it is still yet to make a move. Hike, meanwhile, a chat app unicorn backed by Tencent, was the first to move into messaging payments in June. But its app doesn’t boast the same widespread adoption as WhatsApp or Paytm, which has hindered the impact of its new feature.
Paytm’s business has rocketed over the past year, primarily thanks to the impact of demonetisation, which saw 500 INR and 1,000 INR notes recalled and spurred digital payments in India. The policy helped the number of Paytm wallets jump from 135 million in August to 177 million by the end of December, while offline transactions went from being 15 percent of its volumes to 65 percent.
Growth is still coming — our source said Paytm processed $1 billion in GMV in India in July — but the company is looking to expand its appeal and engagement with users by moving into messaging and content. (There’s also the potential to make money from social games, as chat app Line showed with $1 billion in revenue last year.) The ultimate goal, TechCrunch understands, is to reach 100 million monthly active Paytm users by end of the current Indian business year — that’s a deadline of April 1 2018.
Beyond payments, Paytm also operates an e-commerce service and is planning to enter the digital banking space.
That spread of interests has given hope to rivals like MobiKwik, which is raising new funding at a $1 billion valuation. Co-founder Upasana Taku recently told TechCrunch that she believes Paytm is over-extending itself, leaving its core payment business liable to disruption. It remains to be seen whether this push into mobile messaging changes things.",2017-08-02,1522401,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/paytm-1.jpg?w=738,asia/,"economy,finance,money,e-commerce","Paytm, India’s top digital payment firm, plans to rival WhatsApp with messaging and games",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/paytm-messaging-games-mobile-content-india/
