Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Google’s next-generation Pixel devices could arrive in a little over a month, according to prolific (and often accurate) leak source Evan Blass. The Pixel 2 (or whatever they end up being called) will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 836 mobile system-on-a-chip, Blass claims, and based on previous rumors, these devices look like a solid follow-up to Google’s debut premium Pixel phones.
There will reportedly be both a standard Pixel and an XL version, just like there were last year, with thinner bezels up front surrounding a screen with a narrower 2:1 aspect ratio, like the one found on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6. The 6-inch AMOLED display on the larger XL model will be provided by LG, per reports, and the smaller device will be more of an entry-level offering when compared to last year, where they were basically indistinguishable save for their size.
That smaller Pixel gen 2 device will have thicker bezels than its larger sibling, and a 4.97-inch 1080p display, per reports. One notable change could be front-facing speakers, which would improve sound quality. It’ll also reportedly have ‘squeezable’ sides, which will activate Google Assistant when pressed.
Other rumored tech specs include a report that it’ll have 4GB of RAM on board, and that internal storage might get a boost to 64GB. The camera will get some upgrades, potentially due largely to software, and another rumor suggests it might drop the headphone port which it actually highlighted as a feature differentiator vs. the iPhone last time around.
Google revealed last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL at an event on October 4, so it’s very likely the October 5 date is spot on. With the Galaxy S8, the Note 8 and the Essential Phone, the Android device market on the premium end has changed considerably, however, so we’ll see what Google does with the Pixel to help it continue to stand out.",2017-08-25,1531525,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/google-pixel-2.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"qualcomm,google-pixel",Google’s next Pixel smartphone rumored for October 5 debut,google,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/googles-next-pixel-smartphone-rumored-for-october-5-debut/
Natasha Lomas,Artificial Intelligence,"If you believe the hype, homes in the US are already lousy with speakers containing embodied AI — the most high profile being Amazon’s Echo, in its various incarnations, whose Alexa voice assistant can be commanded to do things like play music, answer trivia questions or tap into third party apps (via an ever-expanding set of so-called ‘skills‘).
But the truth is these virtual personal assistant (VPA) speakers remain very much the domestic exception, not the rule. To give an idea of current and near-term market size, a snapshot forecast put out by Gartner yesterday suggests these VPA-enabled wireless speakers will generate just $3.52BN in global revenue by 2021, up from $0.72BN in 2016.
Gartner tells TechCrunch the forecast is based on estimates of unit sales of between 10-12 million AI speaker devices shipping this year. (Amazon and other makers playing in this space, such as Alphabet with its Google Home speaker, don’t disclose official sales figures.)
For some comparative context, Gartner is expecting the wearables space to generate $30.5BN in revenue this year, off of 310M devices shipped. While the global smartphone market ships more units than a year’s worth of wearables per quarter (~380M) — and more than a billion handsets per year (~1.5BN in 2016).
Still, AI-enabled speakers are definitely having their moment in the sun, as even Apple has decided it’s time to get involved — announcing earlier this summer its own premium offering is on the way. Aka, the HomePod.
“We want to reinvent home music,” was how Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the gadget at the company’s WWDC keynote, showing how Cupertino is thinking about the emergent device within its own business context. Music first, AI last.
Given the evident disconnect between the level of noise being generated by Echo et al, and still very low-level consumer appetite for buying and living with yet another high-tech gizmo — not to mention one that can suck up so much personal data — Apple’s positioning of HomePod as first and foremost a high end audio device makes perfect mainstream market sense.
Apple’s Siri-based voice control — which, in any case, has lagged behind competing voice assistant techs — is being presented as a secondary extra. And that’s not going to be a problem for the company’s target consumer.
The existing Bluetooth wireless speakers market, i.e. speakers that don’t include AI assistants, is clearly orders of magnitude larger, though it’s also at a different stage of development. But one is a proven market; the other is still experimental.
Experimenting with new touchpoint to embed their AIs is certainly the name of the game for Amazon and Google, whose business models focus on driving services revenue streams, rather than trying to make a fat profit on hardware itself.
“If you’re looking at just music, and you’re looking at a dedicated device for that, that’s where the market is at the moment — there’s no doubt,” agrees Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal. “This is music plus,” he says of VPA wireless speakers. “And then you get music plus screen, and you get music plus camera… We’re still seeing them evolve, as to what use-cases they can start fitting into.”
“At the moment [these devices are not that] convenient [for consumers to use]. It’s a little bit hard because it maybe doesn’t understand you… They’re putting them out there so they can get more data, learn more about what people are doing to make the experience better,” he adds. “And that’s the tough part for consumers; because what they’re getting at the moment from a hardware perspective is fine… From an experience perspective it learns. And I think that’s something that users will have to get used to or understand over time. That the device, actually, is getting cleverer as they hold onto it.”
For Amazon, the family of Echos it’s busily building out (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show… ) means all the more virtual, voice-enabled ecommerce touchpoints — so more opportunities to reach new users and get existing users to buy and subscribe to more of its services.
It’s clear that measuring success in this category will not be so tightly tied to hardware volumes shipped. The bigger story is whether these devices can significantly drive the kinds of digital services Amazon, Google et al want in perpetual reach across consumers’ home — keeping their users transacting even when they’re not actively using a smartphone or laptop.
“Whilst the volumes aren’t going to be necessary big, from a hardware perspective, it’s interesting to see the approaches of the vendors in this space,” agrees Atwal. “It’s not like the smartphone market where everybody needs to sell hardware. It’s different approaches that end up with a speaker but there’s a different reason and business model behind it.”
There are also going to be more types of hardware bodies housing AIs in future. Gartner is projecting a temporary slowdown in sales of VPA wireless speakers next year because it expects other types of devices to have virtual assistants baked in — especially in “connected home scenarios” — citing devices like lighting systems, hubs and wi-fi mesh devices.
So the long view here is that voice control gets embedded into everything in the home. Or at least every device or thing where it makes sense.
“Do you want to be talking to your fridge? You probably do, if you open it up and your milk’s about to finish you might actually want to say to your fridge — order me some more milk or put it on my list,” he suggests. “It’s that one to one interaction — I know you’re talking to a piece of metal or a machine — but it’s that convenience level that will slowly but surely people will get comfortable.”
Atwal predicts the smart home may end up comprising a mix of voice-driven interactions plus button-presses to give some rudimentary online abilities to other things — citing another Amazon device, its Dash buttons, which can be stuck next to things like your washing machine or underwear drawer and used as a low friction route to reorder a particular item the moment you realize you’ve run out of soap powder or clean pants.
“It’s going to be a combination of those voice-driven, automated capabilities that will drive how this comes together,” argues Atwal of the smart home. Though its voice that has the really big potential here, if AI can deliver on its potential.
“As voice becomes more of a natural interaction, and conversational, then as it understands the conversation that you’re having with it — I think that’s really where the voice is going to really provide a difference,” he says. “That’s where it will start to hold its own over time, where it can hold a conversation where it remembers what you said previously and puts that in the context of whatever you say next so you’re not repeating the subject matter… so it becomes like you’re having a conversation with a human.”
Of course the current crop of voice-driven devices are nowhere near being able to sustain such sophisticated, contextual human-esque conversations. So while that’s the clear ambition, it’s less evident when (or if) such a breakthrough interface might show its voice.
“That’s somewhere in the future,” says Atwal, adding: “It’s not clear how quickly or otherwise that will come around.”
Another aspect of the smart speaker craze that Gartner discusses in its forecast is privacy considerations — which it recognizes may be preventing some consumers from feeling comfortable installing a listening device linked to a data-harvesting commercial entity inside their homes.
And while its forecast takes the view that consumers’ concerns about privacy will have been “largely” mitigated by 2020 — on account of what it describes as “educational efforts, adoption by peers and regulatory approvals of the device category” — Atwal rows back on this line somewhat.
He says that while various technical and regulatory aspects can be deployed to give the user more “capabilities around privacy” — such as authenticating and identifying who’s talking to a device; and regulating how you register devices in terms of who’s using them and what data flows — in his view there’s still likely to be a “battle” against perceptions of the tech being seen as inherently creepy.
“There’s various ways from a technical or regulatory perspective [device makers] can give the user more capabilities around privacy. But whether the perception for the user around privacy changes, given its voice, and sits in your home and listens, that’s still [a questionmark],” he tells TechCrunch. “Whether the user perception changes over that time is going to be a battle.”
Another Gartner prediction for the space is that beginning in 2019, third-gen VPA speaker products will start shipping with some AI functions running locally on the device, rather than in the cloud — and it says this is, in part, also a consequence of privacy considerations.
Other drivers here include latency and resilience against network downtime.
“Many customers, especially future enterprise clients, require on-premises solutions, in some cases mandated by confidentiality and regulatory requirements,” notes Gartner research director Werner Goertz.
“Privacy, latency, getting things done quicker,” adds Atwal on this. “You don’t need to go back to the cloud to consult up there — there a lot of things that can be done locally because, actually, it’s just to do with you. You don’t need to go off and find out what everybody else is doing to come back and tell you what you want to do.
“So over time… that latency and speed and getting that done has to start happening at a more local level. And again I use two words: one is convenience, and secondly experience. As you get more of a local level technological input that ultimately would have to make that experience better.”",2017-08-25,1531439,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/echo-dot-newsletter.jpg?w=640,gadgets/,"amazon-alexa,amazon-echo,alexa,amazon-com",Putting the voice assistant speaker craze in context,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/putting-the-voice-assistant-speaker-craze-in-context/
Natasha Lomas,Augmented Reality,"Analyst Gartner is expecting to see growth of 16.7 per cent, year-over-year, across the global wearables market this year, which encompasses a variety of device types and form factors — from smartwatches to body-worn cameras and even head-mounted displays.
Its forecast projects sales of 310.4M wearable devices worldwide this year, generating a total of $30.5BN in revenue — of which it expects $9.3BN to come from the smartwatch category specifically, where the Apple Watch currently leads over rivals like Samsung’s Gear smartwatch.
Apple is expected to announce a new model of its smartwatch this September — adding direct cellular connectivity and meaning the Apple Watch will be able to support using its Siri voice assistant, messaging and transferring sensor data without needing an iPhone in close proximity — thereby expanding its utility and potentially giving the product’s prospects with consumers a boost.
The company does not break out unit sales of the Watch, but reporting its latest earnings earlier this month CEO Tim Cook said sales of the wearable were up 50 per cent, year-over-year. (Apple reports earnings for Watch within an ‘other products’ category — which also includes the likes of Apple TVs, Beats electronics devices, iPods and Apple-branded accessories — and the category as a whole earned it $2.74BN in its last quarter.)
Gartner says it expects a total of 41.5M smartwatches to be sold this year, adding that the device type is “on pace” to account for the highest unit sales of all wearable form factors from 2019 to 2021, with the exception of Bluetooth headsets.

By 2021, Gartner estimates that sales of smartwatches will total nearly 81M units — representing 16 per cent of total wearable device sales, according to its forecast.
It notes that smartwatch revenue is bolstered by the relatively stable average selling prices (ASPs) of Apple Watch — a wrist-mounted wearable whose entry price starts at $269.
“The overall ASP of the smartwatch category will drop from $223.25 in 2017 to $214.99 in 2021 as higher volumes lead to slight reductions in manufacturing and component costs, but strong brands such as Apple and Fossil will keep pricing consistent with price bands of traditional watches,” noted Gartner research director, Angela McIntyre, in a statement.
While expecting Apple to continue to lead the smartwatch category, Gartner predicts Cupertino’s share will decline in the coming years — dropping from approximately a third in 2016 to a quarter in 2021 — as more providers enter the market. (Though other brands, such as Asus, Huawei, LG, Samsung and Sony, will still have a lower share — it’s expecting they will account for only 15 per cent in 2021.)
Interestingly, smartphones for children is a sub-category that Gartner’s expecting to perform well — representing 30 per cent of total smartwatch unit shipments in 2021, according to its calculations.
These are wearables aimed at children in the two to 13 year-old range, with makers targeting parents who don’t yet want their child to have a fully fledged smartphone.
The analyst also expects uplift in the traditional watch brand/luxury/fashion smartwatch segment — which it forecasts accounting for 25 percent of smartwatch units by 2021 — as long-standing brands attempt to attract younger customers.
Meanwhile, startup and while-label smartwatch brands, such as Archos, Cogito, Compal, Martian, Omate and Quanta, which will account for five per cent of unit sales in 2021.
Elsewhere in the wearables space, Bluetooth headsets will remain the biggest sub-category, accounting for almost half (48 per cent) of all wearables sold in 2017. The analyst also expects the audio devices to continue to be the most sold type of wearables through 2021, when it projects sales of 206M.
Growth here is being driven by the elimination of the headphone jack by “major smartphone providers”, according to Gartner. And while Apple kicked off that shift — and does of course have a pair of Bluetooth-powered, Siri-primed, premium-priced wireless earbuds to sell you instead (AirPods) — the analyst’s assumption is that by 2021 almost all premium mobile phones will no longer have the 3.5 mm jack. RIP trusty old pairs of headphones the world over.
Meanwhile, one of the tiddler technologies of today’s wearable market — head-mount displays (HMDs) which support augmented reality applications that do not fully block the wearer’s vision (as a full VR headset does) — will continue to be a small player through the next five or so years, according to the analyst.
Gartner forecasts that HMDs will account for just 7 per cent of all wearable devices shipped this year, and says they will not reach mainstream adoption with consumers or industrial customers through 2021. (Which amounts to a bearish view on AR startup Magic Leap‘s near-term prospects — the company still doesn’t have a wearable in the market, though its founder has hinted one could be coming this year.)
Near-term opportunities for HMDs that Gartner points to include: for video game players; for various industrial and business use-cases such as for workers performing equipment repair, inspections and maintenance, or to help with manufacturing, training, design and customer interactions; as well as for entertainment use-cases such as in theme parks, theaters and sports venues, to enhance an experience or provide supplementary information.
“Current low adoption by mainstream consumers shows that the market is still in its infancy, not that it lacks longer-term potential,” added McIntyre of HMDs.",2017-08-24,1530901,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/apple-watch-3.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"wearables,wearable-technology,gartner,wearable-devices","Global wearables market to grow 17% in 2017, 310M devices sold, $30.5BN revenue: Gartner",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/global-wearables-market-to-grow-17-in-2017-310m-devices-sold-30-5bn-revenue-gartner/
Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"Mark down September 12 in your calendar as Apple could be unveiling the next iPhone at 9 AM on that day. Mac4Ever wrote a report saying that it confirmed with telecom companies that Apple should hold a press event on September 12.
This wouldn’t be a big surprise as Apple has been announcing new iPhones every September since 2012. Apple also always holds press conferences on Tuesday for some reason. So many people were hesitating between September 5 and September 12. We’ll know for sure very soon as Apple should be sending press invites in a few days.
So if you’re thinking about buying a new iPhone right now, you should wait a few weeks. Apple usually starts pre-orders on the Friday after the press conference (September 15). And devices go on sale a week later (September 22).
If you don’t plan on buying a new iPhone, you’ll still a get a big software update with iOS 11. Apple is going to release the final version of iOS 11 at some point between September 12 and September 22.
Apple is also probably going to announce a new version of the Apple Watch. The main change with this new watch could be that it’s going to have LTE connectivity. There could be a small update to the Apple TV as well with 4K video output.
Rumor has it that Apple has been working on not one, not two but three different iPhone models. The company should be announcing a more powerful iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, as well as a brand new super premium phone. This rumored “iPhone 8” (or whatever they call it) is going to feature a taller screen that is going to completely fill the front of the device, except for the speaker, camera and sensors at the top.
The camera should be much better on the back and the front of the device. Your phone is also going to learn new tricks when it comes to facial detection, inductive charging and more.",2017-08-23,1530558,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/476364290.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"iphone-event,iphone-8,iphone",Apple could announce the next iPhone on September 12,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/apple-could-announce-the-next-iphone-on-september-12/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"Wireless displays have always had too many compromises to be practically useful for me: Lag, image quality, consistency of connection, on and on. But new hardware from Astropad, the maker of the popular iPad app that you can use to turn your tablet into a drawing tablet, has finally convinced me that high quality, easy and reliable wireless external display tech is within reach, and actually set to be available very soon to consumers thanks to a new Kickstarter project.
Luna Display is a tiny dongle, not much bigger than the average thumb nail, which plugs into either your computer’s Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt, too) or a USB-C or USB 3 (two models will be available) port on modern Macs. The dongle then works with an app on your iPad, connecting using your Wi-Fi network to transfer data between the two.
Why the dongle? Other apps, including Astropad itself, have extended the Mac’s display using Wi-Fi before, after all. The reason is simple: access to your Mac’s graphics card. The dongle can tap into the full hardware graphics acceleration capabilities of the Mac to which its attached, delivering benefits software hacks can’t match, including Metal GPU support. That allows for a very high quality image, with true Retinal support and reliability across visual media types – video included.
The media prototype I received doesn’t have the final fit and finish of the planned production version, but it definitely works like a charm. I’ve long been a user of an iPad as a second display, typically employing the software of Astropad competitor Duet Display and using a wired connection to achieve the results I want.
What’s so amazing about Luna Display is that it offers better visual quality than Duet Display (which is still very good), despite not requiring a direct wired connection to work. The visual fidelity is frankly stunning considering you’re working with a completely untethered connection, and it’s good enough that you can watch YouTube and other videos very enjoyably.
Using the pre-release software and hardware, I did notice some very minor pixelation when moving window, or when viewing animated or video content. It’s not enough to detract from the experience, overall, and this is still an extremely beta version of the final Luna Display product, with software provided via Apple’s TestFlight pre-release provisioning service.
Minor visual eccentricities aside, Luna Display also performs very well in terms of touch response and interaction, which is something that Mac users interested in touchscreen notebooks have been looking for since it became the norm on PC rivals. Pinch to zoom, scrolling and even Apple Pencil support are all available here, and all work very well – better than I’d hoped to imagine they would. Astropad also says the features of its original app, tailored for graphics professionals, will eventually be available via Luna Display as well.
This is really a travel and portability lifesaver in terms of external display solutions, especially if what you’re aiming for isn’t just a purely functional secondary display, but a quality Retina-capable additional monitor with faithful color rendering. The current iPad Pro is a powerhouse in these areas, and being able to quickly and easily employ it as a portable add-on display, which you can also use as effectively a touch-capable Mac in a pinch, is a true game changer.

Luna Display is on Kickstarter now, with a $59 pledge nabbing you either a USB-C or a Mini DisplayPort dongle and delivery starting in May 2018. With the Artist’s Bundle at $99 you get a year of Astropad Studio subscription as well, and there are a number of other options available for backers at higher price points as well.",2017-08-23,1530299,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/147a1542.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,astropad,Astropad’s Luna Display is the portable display solution you’ve always wanted,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/astropads-luna-display-is-the-portable-display-solution-youve-always-wanted/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"The SNES Mini is already causing heaps of FOMO anxiety thanks to pre-orders that are selling out near-instantly, but if any of us DO end up getting our hands on one, the console will have a neat trick up its sleeve for players: In-game rewind.
This would allow players to set a suspend point (up to four can bet set at one time per game), and then rewind their gameplay to try to improve their performance. The feature varies how long you can rewind by game, with a sliding scale ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on how fast the in-game action tends to happen, but it sounds like it’s a thoughtful feature implemented intelligently by Nintendo. Skip to the 2:15 mark in the video below (via Eurogamer) to see the rewind feature in action.
The SNES Classic Edition ships with 21 games installed, including the unreleased sequel to StarFox. The suspend points themselves are super useful for this era, since they give you the ability to quickly and instantly save your progress instead of relying on in-game progress markers, but the rewind feature should mean nostalgic gamers can tackle even points in play that have long frustrated them.

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"It’s not really clear just what “humanoid” robots are actually for. I’ve seen them do all kinds of things, but almost none of them well; at our recent Robotics event in Boston, several leading experts in the field questioned their necessity. But we grew up with Data and Robby and Cylons, and so now we have Pepper. Pepper, performing funeral rites for cash-strapped people in Japan. Really?
This week is ENDEX, the Tokyo International Funeral and Cemetery Show and Life Ending Industry Expo — which, sure, isn’t for everyone, but honestly is a very important industry and one in which technology plays an increasing role.
But while I can get behind the idea of robotic grave cleaners, epitaph etchers, urn retrievers and things along those lines, this seems like a step in the wrong direction.
According to the Japan Times, “Kanagawa-based Nissei Eco Co. will offer Pepper — billed as the world’s first robot that can read emotions — to chant Buddhist sutras at funerals, providing a cheaper alternative to human priests.”
(Just as a quick aside, I don’t buy that Pepper actually reads emotions — no robot or computer vision system can do that. Hell, neither can I most of the time.)
It’s meant to help bring down the costs of funerary services in Japan, where (as elsewhere) they can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. And a real monk would be doing the main part, while Pepper would just be doing the backup sutras. But this is just a bad, dumb idea.
It’s a bad idea to introduce autonomy, or any machine really, into a situation that fundamentally calls for respect and sympathy, because machines have neither.
And it’s a dumb idea because Pepper specifically isn’t good at this job! Humanoid robots are created with the idea of existing and interacting with human spaces. There’s nothing about a human-shaped machine that makes it better at praying. If anything, it’s a mockery of the devotion and care that prayer is meant to embody. Not to mention the whole no-souls thing.
Mechanically it’s no better than playing an MP3 of the sutras on repeat, though it’s a great deal more expensive.
We have to consider with care how we integrate robots, AI, the internet and other technological advances into our lives and cultures. Dull, dirty, and dangerous work (the “three Ds”) are a perfect fit. Shoehorning them in where people are vulnerable like this and need a human touch is distasteful and bizarre.",2017-08-22,1530063,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pepper_fun.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"softbank,pepper","Pepper the robot can perform funerary rites, but it shouldn’t",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/pepper-the-robot-can-perform-funerary-rites-but-it-shouldnt/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Flat-pack furniture made IKEA a global powerhouse, and the same principles may help create a new generation of robots. Interactive Robogami is a project from MIT that lets users create ambulatory robots from a library of pieces that fold and fit together like origami.
“The goal is to make the process of designing robots accessible,” said Adriana Schulz, a PhD student at MIT who co-led the project. “The actuators, the materials, the code, things like that require a lot of knowledge. Our system encapsulates that expert knowledge, so the user can focus on conceptual design.”
Robogami lets users combine a library of intercompatible parts with primitives that can be printed like puzzle pieces and then folded and locked into shape. The flat-printed style reduces both print time and material cost by more than half.
It has a user-friendly GUI that has more in common with a game or 3D doodle app than a CAD or other design environment. You drag the pieces where you want them, arrange the type and placement of the feet or wheels and add any other features you think might be useful (or cool-looking). Then you can work out how and when those parts will move, what direction and so on.
Meanwhile, the app is doing all kinds of calculations in the background.
“One of the key things is that you can design geometry and motion at the same time. Normally that’s two different processes, but here you can change one and see how it affects the other,” said Schulz.
“The ordering of the how the legs move, the speed, these are all parametric structures,” she said. How they interact is systematized and you don’t have to worry about, for example, synchronizing motor torques or timing a foot’s touchdown — it’s being calculated internally. “The software maps these components into a full fabrication plan, from the mesh that goes to the 3D printer to the motors and code, the user doesn’t have to worry — it’s very end to end.”
For instance, if you decide to move the front legs back toward the center, the software calculates how that might affect when and how fast they move, or whether their motion would interfere with another piece. It watches for things like wobbliness, changes in orientation and center of gravity.
It might sound a little like baby’s first robot kit, but it’s clearly a versatile tool. Robogami users of varying levels of familiarity with CAD and engineering tools took part in a handful of tests. “We were really surprised by the diversity of models people made,” Schulz told me. It took about 15-30 minutes to design a robot, a few hours to print it, then 30-90 minutes to assemble it.
The tool isn’t aimed at any population in particular, Schulz told me (other than “anybody”), but I thought this would make for an amazing couple of weeks in a high school or college engineering course, perhaps even earlier. Design your own little bots, print them overnight, assemble them to understand how the motors and chassis fit together, then race them or have them navigate obstacles.

Right now Robogami is just the subject of the researchers’ paper, now published in the International Journal of Robotics Research. But Schulz said the goal was to move beyond mere locomotion and into other tasks. “Empowering people to design complex things is difficult! But I think it would be exciting to create tools that lower design barriers for casual users.”
“These tools enable new approaches to teaching computational thinking and creating,” said Daniela Rus, director of MIT’s CSAIL and collaborator on the research, in a news release. “Students can not only learn by coding and making their own robots, but by bringing to life conceptual ideas about what their robots can actually do.”",2017-08-22,1529842,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/img_5525.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"csail,mit","MIT’s Robogami lets you build custom 3D-printable robots from standard, folding parts",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/mits-robogami-lets-you-build-custom-3d-printable-robots-from-standard-folding-parts/
Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"Nintendo has added a new payment option for eShop purchases on the Nintendo Switch and on its website. Starting today, you can now link your Nintendo account to your PayPal account and pay for future purchases using your PayPal balance or any payment method already linked to your PayPal account.
This update is only about the Switch. If you’re still using a Wii U or Nintendo 3DS, you’re out of luck. So the next time you purchase something on your Switch, you either can add your credit card information, use a saved credit card or add your PayPal account.
This option is particularly useful for a couple of reasons. First, the Switch is a region-free console, meaning that you can play games you bought in another country with your console.
But Nintendo didn’t stop at physical games. You can buy Japanese games on the eShop even if you bought your console in the U.S. Or you can pay in U.S. dollars even if you live in Europe. There are many reasons why it’s nice to be able to access other stores.
If you want to access another store, you need to add a new account to your Switch. You can then buy games in different stores. They’ll all appear on your home screen without any distinction.
But some banks charge some expensive foreign transaction fees. While PayPal isn’t perfect, it could be a better option if you’re trying to buy games in a foreign currency depending on your bank.
Second, PayPal is a nice option if you have kids. Instead of saving your credit card information to your kids’ console, you can create a PayPal account for them and credit some money. This way, they can buy stuff on their own and you can limit their purchases.
PayPal’s integration for the Switch is available in Japan, the U.S., Canada and 31 European countries.",2017-08-22,1529710,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/switch-2270037.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"nintendo-switch,switch,nintendo",Nintendo adds PayPal support to the Nintendo Switch,paypal,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/nintendo-adds-paypal-support-to-the-nintendo-switch/
Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"It turns out that providing unlimited data is quite expensive. Ars Technica spotted that Verizon is revamping its plans and now sells you two kinds of unlimited data — Go Unlimited and Beyond Unlimited. (Disclosure: Verizon owns Oath, which owns TechCrunch.)
And the biggest change is probably that mobile video is now capped at a maximum resolution of 480p. You won’t be able to stream any HD video on Netflix or YouTube with the basic unlimited plan (Update: video is capped at 480p on phones and 720p on tablets). Verizon has already run tests in July throttling Netflix and online video in general.
Instead of acting as a dumb data pipe, Verizon is looking at what you’re doing with your phone and sending you data at a slower speed if you’re doing things that could cost Verizon a lot of money.
Verizon launched an $80 unlimited data plan back in February. This previous plan was quite straightforward. You could do whatever you wanted with your phone until you reached 22GB of usage. After that, you would get reduced speeds. You could also use your phone as a hotspot for 10GB per month.
But this plan led to more pressure on the network and increased costs. So the company had to do something to turn this great consumer-friendly idea into a viable business venture.
The entry-level Go Unlimited plan is now $5 cheaper, but it also comes with a ton of restrictions. In addition to 480p video, you can experience reduced speeds at all times to reduce network congestion, even if you only use a couple of gigabytes per month. Of course, you can always upgrade to Beyond Unlimited if you’re too frustrated with those restrictions.
Even worse, mobile hotspot speed is limited to 600kbps. The company says you get unlimited data when you’re tethering, but 600kbps is so slow that you’ll give up on tethering in no time. In fact, if you use mobile hotspot for an hour, you can only download around 260MB of data — it’s that slow.
Forget about YouTube. Even just loading nytimes.com completely, a 3.8MB page, would take you 51 seconds at full speed.
You can pay $10 more for the Beyond Unlimited plan ($85). This plan looks more or less like the old unlimited plan, with a 22GB limit. You can tether for up to 15GB per month. But videos are still capped at 720p on your phone and 1080p on your other devices. Existing customers will still pay $80 per month, but video will be throttled. How hard is it to let users decide what to do with their data allowance?
If you think other carriers are nicer, AT&T also has two different unlimited plans (“Unlimited Choice” and “Unlimited Plus”) with restrictions on video. T-Mobile’s basic unlimited plan also limits video to 480p. Sprint doesn’t limit video but throttles your speed when you’re streaming music.
In other words, rest in peace net neutrality. If only the FCC was courageous enough to prevent carriers from branding their plans as “unlimited” when those plans are nothing but unlimited…",2017-08-22,1529663,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/gettyimages-645846618.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"verizon-wireless,verizon",Verizon throttles video for good with its not-so-unlimited plan,net-neutrality,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/verizon-throttles-video-for-good-with-its-new-not-so-unlimited-unlimited-plan/
John Biggs,Gadgets,"The Multimodal Autonomous Drone (S-MAD) is a fixed-wing drone that has a few bird-like tricks up its sleeve. You can, for example, fly it like a glider through a room or open space, but when it approaches a flat surface the drone quickly changes configuration and lands flat with its little spiky teeth digging in to keep it from falling. In short, this is one of the scariest robotic behaviors I’ve seen since Big Dog galumphed its way into our nightmares.
The S-MAD uses something called microspines to attach itself to rough surfaces. The spines are essentially hardened steel spikes that grip small bumps in a surface from two directions — “the opposed-grip strategy for microspines is just like a human hand grasping a bottle of water, except that while humans require some macroscopic curvature to get our fingers around both sides of an object, the microspines can go deep into the micro-features of a rough surface and latch on those tiny bumps and pits,” said researcher Hao Jiang of Stanford. These spines are already being used on multi-rotor drones, but this is the first time they’ve been used on a fixed-wing device. The plane now lands on surfaces 100 percent of the time, an impressive feat for such a drone.
With these microspines, the plane can flatten itself against a wall and perch there, gathering data and scanning the environment. When it’s ready to move on, it releases the spines and flies off into the wild blue. Researchers Dino Mehanovic, John Bass, Thomas Courteau, David Rancourt and Alexis Lussier Desbiens from the University of Sherbrooke decided to connect these spines with a fixed-wing drone and had to create a new way to essentially stop the plane in mid-air — something birds are quite adept at — and settle on a surface. The system switches from plane to helicopter in a split second, allowing it to flatten against the wall instantly. From Spectrum:
This is obviously a proof of concept, but it could be used in situations where long-distance glides terminate in a permanent perch at some high point for data collection. After the data is collected, the plane can essentially fall off the surface and fly back by righting itself, climbing to altitude and gliding home.",2017-08-21,1529077,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/mjk0mjm5oa.jpeg?w=620,gadgets/,"drone,airplane,music",New drone perches on walls like a robotic bird,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/new-drone-perches-on-walls-like-a-robotic-bird/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"If you’re going to be decking your roof out with solar tiles, there’s a possibility that you may forgo what might be the best placement of a skylight in favor of more solar cell square footage. Luckily solar glass is fast becoming an option, and these clever glass blocks are the best option I’ve seen yet.
	
Researchers at the University of Exeter thought up an interesting alternative that may be the best of both worlds (until the next breakthrough, anyway). They created these thick blocks of glass with optical features — not quite lenses or tunnels, but sort of light guides — that funnel light from a large area on the sunny side of the window onto a much smaller cell on the inside.
By concentrating the light onto a smaller point, you get considerably more energy out of the cell’s tiny surface area than if it were ordinarily illuminated. It won’t be as much as a full-on cell covering that amount of space, but at least it’s transparent! Apart from the little cells and the wires connecting them, of course, which actually make a rather cool-looking pattern.
And because of their thickness, these Solar Squared units, as they’re called, even provide decent insulation.
Free light, free power, and free thermal insulation — or free after it pays for itself, anyway. That could make it attractive to larger building designers, who are always looking to integrate energy-saving, green features like this into their work.
Solar Squared is being spun off from the University as an independent business endeavor — a company called Build Solar.
Of course you can’t order these things right now — it’s still a prototype and they’re waiting on the patent to go through. But it’s a smart idea and one that seems likely to find its footing in the commercial world.

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"While we usually see robotics applied to industrial or research applications, there are plenty of ways they could help in everyday life as well: an autonomous guide for blind people, for instance, or a kitchen bot that helps disabled folks cook. Or — and this one is real — a robot arm that can perform rudimentary sign language.
It’s part of a masters thesis from grad students at the University of Antwerp who wanted to address the needs of the deaf and hearing impaired. In classrooms, courts and at home, these people often need interpreters — who aren’t always available.
Their solution is “Antwerp’s Sign Language Actuating Node,” or ASLAN, highlighted here by 3D Hubs. It’s a robotic hand and forearm that can perform sign language letters and numbers. It was designed from scratch and built from 25 3D-printed parts, with 16 servos controlled by an Arduino board. It’s taught gestures using a special glove, and the team is looking into recognizing them through a webcam as well.
Right now, it’s just the one hand — so obviously two-hand gestures and the cues from facial expressions that enrich sign language aren’t possible yet. But a second coordinating hand and an emotive robotic face are the next two projects the team aims to tackle.
The idea is not to replace interpreters, whose nuance can hardly be replicated, but to make sure that there is always an option for anyone worldwide who requires sign language service. It also could be used to help teach sign language — a robot doesn’t get tired of repeating a gesture for you to learn.

Why not just use a virtual hand? Good question. An app or even a speech-to-text program would accomplish many of the same things. But it’s hard to think less of the ASLAN project; taking an assistive technology off the screen and putting it in the real world, where it can be interacted with, viewed from many angles, and otherwise share the physical space of the people it helps, is a commendable goal.
ASLAN was created by Guy Fierens, Stijn Huys and Jasper Slaets. It’s still in prototype form, but once it’s finalized the designs will be open sourced.",2017-08-18,1528737,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/255756-ua-robotarm-9-4e79b6-large-1502877454.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,sign-language,This 3D-printed robotic arm is built for sign language,3d-printing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/this-3d-printed-robotic-arm-is-built-for-sign-language/
Lucas Matney,Gadgets,"For all the talk of how voice assistants could be the future of IoT or computing in general, the only consistently engaging use of home assistants like Echo or Google Home seems to be audio playback.
Today, Google is making it a bit easier for the cheapos to get in on the action, as it’s beginning to roll out support for Spotify free accounts on its Home platform. Google announced the integration was coming back at its Google I/O conference.
Currently, the company’s home assistant supports Google Play Music Free and Premium, Spotify Free and Premium, Pandora, YouTube Music, TuneIn and iHeartRadio. Deezer and SoundCloud support should be on the way soon as support for them was also announced at I/O.
Life in the free lane isn’t as glamorous on Home with Spotify, as there are a few differences in the way you can use the service. First off, you won’t be able to get the Home to play specific songs, albums or artists, instead you’ll have to settle for selecting music by mood, genre or one of the Spotify-curated playlists.
Things get dialed in a little bit more when you’re requesting Google Assistant to play Spotify on a Chromecast audio-enabled device, in which case you’ll be able to request specific playlists or artists and hear the applicable jams on shuffle. If you’re casting to a TV, your experience should be pretty comparable to what you get on Premium, with abilities to request songs, playlists, artists and albums all supported.
Check out the full spread on what you can and can’t do with Spotify Free on Google Home here.

John Biggs,Fundings & Exits,"Duke Robotics, a military contractor, has produced a video for their unique and uniquely dangerous new tool, TIKAD. This drone platform looks fairly basic – a custom multi-rotor drone with a chassis on the bottom to hold what looks like a stripped down machine gun, sniper rifle, or grenade launcher – but what it suggests about the future of warfare is pretty scary.
A gimbal at the bottom of the drone holds the gun steady as you aim and fire remotely via a video-capable control pad. All of this is possible with current technology and there have been examples of this kind of tech over the years, most recently with the Switchblade project. The technology is basic – I suspect DJI or a similar drone manufacturer could build this in a weekend – but it’s the target market and marketing that is the most interesting.
“TIKAD allows governments to utilize completely new capabilities against terrorist groups and reduce the number of deployed ground troops, and therefore, the number of casualties,” write TIKAD’s creators and they are currently raising funds to build more of these. In short, this viral video is essentially a massive marketing effort to support the company’s equity crowdfunding plan. After all, who doesn’t love a drone with a gun attached?
Duke is saying they are currently in testing with the Israeli army and they are also doing a sort of online crowd sale for investment which is why they produced such a titillating video. Given the current state of drone technology a product like this would be dangerous for use in real situations but with a bit of engineering and improvement you could have something that could launch from a distant location, move in for the kill, and then fly back. It could also, like so many drones on the market, explode when it hits a tree.
So take TIKAD with a grain of salt. This is an investment strategy, not a final product and, I suspect if it were that easy to stick a gun onto a drone we’d have something smaller than the Predator flying around. However if you want some good old-fashioned war footage with rendered drones flying in to destroy enemies of freedom, look no further than Duke’s video below.

Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"LogMeIn, the company that provides authentication and other connectivity solutions for those who connect remotely to networks and services, has made another acquisition to expand the products it offers to customers, specifically in its new Bold360 CRM platform, launched in June. The company has picked up Nanorep, a startup out of Israel that develops chatbots and other AI-based tools to help people navigate self-service apps.
LogMeIn is paying $45 million plus up to $5 million more in earn-outs based on performance and employees staying put over the next two years.
Nanorep had raised just under $7 million from investors that included Titanium out of Russia (which had also backed Cloudyn, recently acquired by Microsoft), Oryzn Capital and OurCrowd.
The startup already had around 500 large customers, including big names like FedEx, Toys“R”Us and Vodafone. In essence, its platform helps anticipate what customers are trying to do when they’re on a website — say in a technical support or search situation — and reduces the number of steps needed to get there. It looks like all of Nanorep’s existing business will continue as its tech also gets integrated into Bold360.
LogMeIn’s launch of Bold360 earlier this year was intended to help the company expand the range of services that it offered to customers, beyond authentication and IT management within an organisation, and into more cloud-based services where the business interfaces with its customers.
However, the CRM space is already very crowded, and so it’s no surprise to see that LogMeIn has made an acquisition to add more features to the service to help set it apart from the pack.
With Nanorep, it’s also tapping into the recent enthusiasm and interest in AI and building “intelligent” services that mimic human behaviours, specifically in CRM.
“Artificial intelligence is changing the way we interact with our favorite brands and will play a critical role in the future of customer engagement,” said Bill Wagner, CEO, LogMeIn, in a statement. “With Nanorep, we gain proven technology and AI expertise that expands our Bold360 offering, accelerates our customer engagement vision and provides a natural path for us to leverage these emerging technologies across our entire portfolio. We believe in the ability of technology to unlock the potential of the modern workforce and with the addition of Nanorep we are going to be able to deliver solutions that will help our customers achieve the next generation of humanized and personalized customer service.”
Although LogMeIn has acquired Nanobot to help raise its game in CRM, on another level this is also an important move just to keep up.
Gartner predicts that “conversational agents” — which you can interpret as a more fancy way of saying “chatbots” — will account for 30 percent of all customer service interactions by 2022, up from just three percent today.
There are many others that are also active in this same area, including Salesforce with its Einstein AI, Gong, which provides real-time processing and teaching to live agents; and Hubspot, which just made an acquisition of its own, of Kemvi.
What Nanorep is tapping into that is interesting is the fact that the vast range of businesses in the world are not tech-centric, and so they will be less capable of building AI solutions like chatbots themselves, nor will they want to spend an arm and a leg to get them: like all software, AI is gradually moving into the realm of being off-the-shelf, and LogMeIn is hoping to be a part of that trend.

John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"Facebook has gone ahead and purchased Charles Jolley’s conversational AI startup Ozlo. Jolley, formerly Head of Platform for Android at Facebook, will not be returning to the company. The Ozlo team is expected to join Facebook to work on natural language processing challenges.
Ozlo launched with a consumer-facing app back in October 2016. Jolley told me at the time that the conversational AI space was rapidly consolidating (Samsung had just bought Viv) and he was happy to run a service independent of the major tech giants. With today’s acquisition, Ozlo is no longer independent and the conversational AI space grows just a bit more consolidated.
In March, Ozlo launched a suite of APIs. One of the company’s key differentiators was its knowledge graph — its database of facts about the world necessary for demonstrating any sense of intelligence. Ozlo sold its knowledge layer to developers as a service.
That knowledge layer, in addition to an intent API and converse API, will be wound down in the wake of the acquisition, according to Facebook. The same will be true for the original, readily available, consumer bot.
“1.2 billion people around the world use Messenger to connect with the people and businesses they care about,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the Ozlo team as we build compelling experiences within Messenger that are powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.”
It’s unclear exactly what the Ozlo team will work on at Facebook. The Ozlo knowledge graph could find a home as a backbone for Facebook M. A number of recent acquisitions by large tech companies have been aimed at increasing the scale of such information repositories. Apple recently purchased Lattice Data to help convert unstructured data into a knowledge graph that can be reasoned across to deliver relevant answers to user questions.

John Biggs,Enterprise,"In an unsurprising move by credit card thieves, police have found a new credit card skimmer that sends stolen data via SMS. By tearing apart cheap phones, crooks are able to send credit card information to their location instantly without having to access the skimmer physically or rely on an open Bluetooth connection.
Brian Krebs received images of the skimmer from an unnamed source. They were found at a gas station in the Northeast.
This skimmer connected to the internals of the pump and received power from the pump itself, meaning there was no need to worry about the battery failing. It’s unclear how this model worked but most likely it intercepts the credit card data as it’s being swiped. There’s still hope, however, because gas stations are trying to fight back.
“Many filling stations are upgrading their pumps to include more physical security — such as custom locks and security cameras. In addition, newer pumps can accommodate more secure chip-based payment cards that are already in use by all other G20 nations,” wrote Krebs.

Matthew Lynley,Earnings,"Amazon reported its second-quarter earnings today, and it was a bit of a whiff — and a bummer for Jeff Bezos, who is now no longer the solar system’s richest human and has been relegated to the unfortunate position of second-richest human.
The company’s earnings came in lighter than Wall Street expected. But Amazon’s cloud server farms, AWS, once again appear to be propping up Amazon’s profitability. The company’s huge bet on building up the basis of modern cloud computing could, in a way, be held partially responsible for Amazon’s long streak of profitability for the past many quarters.
Here’s a quick breakdown of that:
Amazon has turned AWS into a business that’s on track to generate well over $10 billion in revenue annually. It also has some of the best margins of all of Amazon’s lines of business, and it continues to grow at a very healthy rate. AWS revenue was up 42 percent in the second quarter compared to 2016. That growth is slowing a bit, as AWS revenue was up 58 percent between 2015 an 2016.
Perhaps most importantly, Amazon signaled that it might return to losing money in the next quarter. Amazon has long been known to burn cash in the quest to continue to grow into one of the largest companies in the world, and Wall Street has generally been quite patient with that strategy. Yet despite that, Amazon put together a string of strong quarters and profitability, and on the year the company’s stock is up 40 percent.
It looks like that huge bet on building a bunch of buildings with servers inside is paying off as Amazon continues to look into other lines of revenue. Amazon is well known to bulldoze its way into new businesses, whether that’s buying a ton of grocery stores for $13.7 billion or running a video streaming service for people playing video games. While AWS’s growth is slowing, it certainly looks like it may be one of Amazon’s buoys for some time to come.",2017-07-27,1520279,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/amazon-echo.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"finance,aws",It looks like Amazon would be losing a lot of money if not for AWS,amazon,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/it-looks-like-amazon-would-be-losing-a-lot-of-money-if-not-for-aws/
John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"Intel declared $14.8 billion in revenue this afternoon and earnings per share of 72 cents. This represents a solid beat as analysts had expected revenues of $14.41 billion and EPS of 68 cents.
The company’s  stock finished up 22 cents and 0.63 percent to $34.97 per share in regular trading. In the moments after the company released its earnings, Intel’s stock shot up 3.43 percent. It is currently trading at $36.17 in after-hours trading (~1:05pm PST).
Intel is in an interesting spot as a company. It knows that in the future its fate is sealed in its ability to execute on artificial intelligence. It will win or die on Wall Street depending on whether it can convert its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye into a thriving business unit serving the needs of the soon to be massive autonomous vehicle industry. Intel says its acquisition of Mobileye is expected to close in Q3 2017.
But today, despite three acquisitions — Mobileye, Movidius and Nervana — the important conversation is still data centers. Intel has long dominated the data center with its x86 chips. With increasing pressure from AMD, it’s unclear how much longer Intel will be able to nap, undisturbed, on top of the data center market. But for now, Intel was able to present 9 percent growth in the business unit.

In Q2 2016, Intel reported revenue of $13.5 billion. At the time that represented a 3 percent year-over-year improvement. Today’s Q2 2017 report reflects a 9 percent year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Intel expects to see $15.7 billion in revenue for Q3 2017 and EPS of 80 cents per share. On the year, Intel is projecting $61.3 billion in revenue and $3.00 EPS. Some of this value will be generated by Mobileye once the acquisition is complete.

Anthony Ha,Enterprise,"Peer5, which helps publishers stream video to large audiences, is announcing that it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding.
I wrote about the startup earlier this year when it was part of Y Combinator. CEO Hadar Weiss said he raised the funding after YC Demo Day from investors including FundersClub, Oriza Ventures, Tank Hill Ventures, Leorsa Group, Ed Roman and Buddy Anheim.
In Weiss’ words, the problem that Peer5 is trying to solve is that “the Internet simply can’t hold TV-sized audiences.” In other words, the existing infrastructure can’t deliver video to millions of concurrent viewers — think of times you’ve tried to watch a popular show like Game of Thrones and the video just kept freezing up.
Peer5 aims to solve this by sitting on top of the existing CDNs. The CDNs still push the video out to the initial viewers, but those viewers’ devices can then be used to push video to other viewers — Weiss has compared it to adding lanes to a highway.
To do this, Peer5 uses WebRTC technology, which both Microsoft and Apple have recently said they will support. Weiss explained that usually, the video publishers offer different incentives (such as a higher-quality broadcast) to viewers so that they opt-in to participate.
How many viewers can Peer5 handle? Weiss said the company recently supported its first event with more than 1 million concurrent viewers, up from 40,000 two years ago. Next up: Trying to get to 10 million concurrent viewers.
“We believe that we are at the beginning of a massive technological shift in the TV industry,” Weiss said in an email. “Over time, as TV continues to come online, P2P CDNs like Peer5, will simply be mandatory at that scale!”",2017-07-27,1519952,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-128584852.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"cdns,hadar-weiss,peer5",Peer5 raises $2.5M for its peer-to-peer approach to streaming video,y-combinator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/peer5-funding/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Sometimes combining two companies that compete in the same market provides a quick way to leapfrog your market share. That was likely the thinking behind Mitel’s decision to buy ShoreTel this morning for $430 million.
Combining the two companies catapults Mitel to number two in the Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) market, according to the company.
As for ShoreTel, while it will get absorbed in the deal, it received a 28 percent premium over the closing stock price yesterday. The deal looks like this: Mitel will pay $7.50 a share for a total value of $430 million in an all-cash deal.
It’s worth noting, however, that Mitel attempted to buy ShoreTel in 2014 in an unsolicited offer for $8.10 a share and the ShoreTel board rejected the offer, saying that it significantly undervalued the company. That has obviously changed as ShoreTel peaked at around $10.32 a share in December 2015 before beginning a drop that bottomed out at $5.75 a share earlier this month. When Mitel came a-courtin’ this time, ShoreTel didn’t play hard to get. But it could have gotten more in 2014.
With the stroke of a pen, Mitel now has almost doubled its UCaaS revenue to $263 million, and there will be other efficiencies achieved by combining the two companies with similar markets.
“This is a very natural combination that enables us to continue to consolidate the industry and take advantage of cost synergy opportunities while adding new technologies and significant cloud growth to our business,” Mitel CEO Rich McBee said in a statement.
According to Synergy Research, the UCaaS market is divided into two segments — standalone applications and business suites. Mitel and ShoreTel are part of the suite side of the market along with RingCentral, 8×8 and Vonage.
While Synergy estimated that the overall UCaaS business was around $4 billion as of January, 2016, two-thirds of this was allocated to stand-alone applications like video conferencing with a third going to business suites where Mitel and ShoreTel live.
The two companies when combined will have 3200 channel partners and 4200 employees worldwide. The deal is still subject to regulatory and shareholder review before it can close.
What’s never clear in a deal like this is how well the two companies will work together as a single entity, what impact it will have on employees and how Mitel will absorb and service ShoreTel’s customer base. All of that remains to be seen, but for today, if all goes as planned, the two become one.",2017-07-27,1519905,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-145671614.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"shoretel,mitel,mergers-and-acquisitions",Mitel to buy ShoreTel for $430 million to create unified communications powerhouse,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/mitel-to-buy-shoretel-for-430-million-to-create-unified-communications-powerhouse/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Salesforce announced an update to its Service Cloud today, which the company says enables non-technical administrators to build a customer service organization with connected services in less than a day.
That’s a bold claim, even for the marketing department, but the Service Cloud app builder has been built on top of the Salesforce Lightning development platform and designed to drag and drop components from Salesforce and third parties into the Service Cloud app building interface. This should allow users to add components like Facebook, email or Twitter integration with a proverbial “few clicks.”
There will be 75 integration components available in the Salesforce AppExchange at launch, according to the company. Some examples include Dialpad, which lets a rep make a call from inside the customer record; MapAnything Live, which lets reps follow delivery and service vehicles on a map in real time; and Healthwise, which lets a consultant connect a patient to relevant health education materials.
Keith Pearce, VP of marketing for Service Cloud at Salesforce, says the new approach has been designed to allow administrators to add these functions without coding or help from IT. He acknowledges that if a component isn’t available, it could take more than a day, and perhaps some IT help to build more customized components.
Pearce says that younger employees don’t want to be using their parents’ customer service platform. They want a clean modern experience and the new Service Cloud is designed to show them the onslaught of customer requests in a more organized way.
 
 
Other new features include federated search to find information faster, a macro builder for building macros for common customer service tasks, and what they call a 360 degree view of the customer, to see all of the previous interactions with this customer in one place. For instance, it could show that the person on the line called about this problem several times before, which could explain why they are being so hostile.
Finally, if your employees are workaholics or they are working in the field, they can access customer information from the convenience of their smartphones, to check on the status of their customer’s requests.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Salesforce announcement without Trailhead training components, so people can learn how to use these tools more effectively.
If companies are able to truly streamline their customer service offering as quickly as advertised, while offering a more modern experience for customers and reps, Salesforce will be onto something. But as always, the proof of the pudding is going to be in the tasting.",2017-07-27,1519449,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-57433249.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"customer-service,service-cloud",Salesforce claims you can set up customer service in Service Cloud update in less than a day,salesforce,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/salesforce-claims-you-can-set-up-new-service-cloud-in-less-than-a-day/
Katie Roof,Enterprise,"Enterprise messaging service Slack is raising a $250 million round at a $5 billion valuation, TechCrunch has confirmed. We’re hearing that SoftBank, Accel Partners and other existing investors participated.
The $250 million financing amount was reported by Bloomberg. Axios first had the names of the lead investors. Recode originally reported on a $500 million round last month, but we’re hearing that was likely in reference to the same round and the amount just wound up being $250 million.
There have also been various reports about acquisition conversations, but at least one source with direct knowledge claims the parties never came close to finalizing a deal.
Yet investors certainly believe Slack has strong “exit” potential. Over $500 million in equity funding has been disclosed so far, and the $5 billion valuation means that some investors believe it will be acquired or go public at a value significantly higher than that.
We use Slack at TechCrunch for much of our internal communication. A lot of people love the instant messaging service for its modern interface. (And gifs! Some people are really excited about the Giphy integration.)
Slack has almost a cult following in Silicon Valley, but much of its success will be contingent on whether it is able to convince large enterprises around the world to switch services. Slack has touted itself as an alternative to email, but it’s not a platform for communicating with people outside your company.

Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Barely a day passes without some news about containers and that speaks to how quickly this technology is being adopted by developers and the platforms and startups that serve them. Today it’s Microsoft’s turn to launch a new container service for its Azure cloud computing platform: Azure Container Instances (ACI).
The company also today announced that it is joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation as a platinum member (that’s a $370,000/year commitment).
While we’ve seen our fair share of container-centric services from the major cloud vendors, ACI is different from the likes of Azure’s existing Container Service, AWS’s EC2 Container Service and the Google Container Engine.
ACI, which is now in preview, is all about simplicity. It lets you spin up a single container with your choice of memory and CPU cores in a few seconds and usage is billed by the second. As Microsoft stresses, these containers are first-class objects on Azure and get all of the same role-based access controls, billing tags and other features that you’d expect on the platform. These containers are isolated from other customers using “proven virtualization technology,” Microsoft says.
What you don’t get, however, is the hassle of having to manage VMs or learning about container orchestration. If you do want to use orchestration, though, you can do that with the help of Microsoft’s new open source Kubernetes connector. This allows Kubernetes clusters to deploy containers directly to ACI and lets developers mix and match VMs and ACI as needed.

Right now, ACI only supports Linux containers but it will soon also support Windows Containers as well. Deploying a container only takes a single command with a few basic parameters and you can pull containers from public repositories like the Docker Hub or our private repositories on Azure.
Given its speed, the main use case of ACI is probably for bursty workloads and scaling. One of the main advantages of containers is that you can easily move them between services, so going from ACI to a more traditional VM-based container infrastructure shouldn’t be a problem.
“This offers a level of agility for deploying Kubernetes, unlike any other cloud provider, enabling services that start in seconds without any underlying VMs and  are billed and scaled per second,” Corey Sanders, Microsoft’s Head of Product for Azure Compute, writes in today’s announcement.

As Sanders also announced today, Microsoft has decided to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Platinum Member. The foundation hosts the Kubernetes project, as well as a growing number of other open source tools that help developers build, monitor and manage container-based applications. Other CNCF Platinum members include the likes of Cisco, CoreOS, Dell Technologies, Docker, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent and RedHat. The CNCF is a Collaborative Project of the Linux Foundation — which Microsoft joined last year.
“Cloud native technologies like Kubernetes enable better developer productivity, higher frequency deployments and more efficient utilization of computing resources,” Dan Kohn, Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, told me. “Active engagement by companies like Microsoft means that cloud native will increasingly be the standard way to deploy software both for new, greenfield applications and the standard platform for evolving existing monolithic applications into the cloud native future.”",2017-07-26,1519084,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-594833497.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,containers,Microsoft’s new Azure Container Instances make using containers fast and easy,"microsoft-azure,microsoft",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/microsofts-new-azure-container-instances-make-using-containers-fast-and-easy/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"OpenText, the content management company based in Waterloo, Ontario announced today that it was buying Guidance Software, a forensic security and eDiscovery vendor for $240 million.
OpenText agreed to pay Guidance shareholders $7.10 a share. The price will be less Guidance’s cash on hand of approximately $18 million, making the final price just around $222 million, according to OpenText. Under the terms of the purchase, the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of OpenText.
OpenText has never been afraid to open its wallet to fill in a hole (or even buy something with overlapping functionality). As a case in point, just about a year ago, it bought Documentum, a competing enterprise content management firm, from EMC for $1.62 billion.
This acquisition gives the company some overlapping functionality too, but Cheryl McKinnon, an analyst with Forrester Research who monitors the content management industry, says it also gives the company forensics tools, which are new to them.
“It certainly adds, with some overlap, to their eDiscovery and file analytics portfolio (i.e. , those tools to clean up network drives, detect sensitive text inside documents, etc.). But OpenText has never had anything focused more on the forensic side of the discovery business. — that is, more security, deeper inspection of how information [has been] accessed, copied, etc. So that forensics side is net new for them,” McKinnon explained.
Not surprisingly, the company is focusing on that forensic piece in its announcement, but it’s also getting a rich set of eDiscovery tools, and a customer list that includes 78 of the Fortune 100 companies, according to the Guidance website.
Tony Byrne, founder and principal analyst at the Real Story Group, a firm that watches the content management industry, says the deal is really about giving them access to that customer base.
“The important thing to know about OpenText is that they generally don’t buy technology. They buy mature customer bases and milk the maintenance revenue. This is no different. It’s been an effective financial strategy for them, but for customers a mixed bag,” he told TechCrunch.
Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder at the analyst firm, Deep Analysis, predicts OpenText could be just getting started when it comes to acquisitions. “I  doubt it will be the last such acquisition by OpenText this year, indeed I expect to see more similar sized deals before year end,” he said.
As for the price tag, he said it’s about twice revenue, which is what you would expect on a deal like this one.
Regardless, the purchase should close in the third quarter of this year.",2017-07-26,1519255,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/opentextrhofficebuilding.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"content-management,guidance-software,opentext,mergers-and-acquisitions",OpenText acquires forensic security vendor Guidance Software for $240 million,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/opentext-acquires-forensic-security-vendor-guidance-software-for-240-million/
Katie Roof,Enterprise,"British enterprise software company Sage Group has agreed to purchase Intacct, a 19-year-old accounting software company, for $850 million, the companies announced today.
A cash and stock transaction, the deal aims to help build out Sage’s cloud financial management offerings.
Intacct, which competes with Financial Force and Oracle’s NetSuite, said in a related statement that it now has 11,000 customers for its enterprise resource planning software. Its revenue for its fiscal year ending in June 2016 was $67 million, with pre-tax losses of $23 million.
The exit was a long-time coming for Intacct. The San Jose-based outfit had raised more than $130 million in equity funding, dating back to 2000. Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Sigma Partners and Emergence Capital were among its backers. Its most recent round, a Series G that closed in early 2014, valued the company at $211 million, according to PitchBook data.
“This is an ‘overnight success’ many years in the making,” Bessemer Venture Partners’ Byron Deeter quipped. An investor and former board member, he believes “Intacct is at the scale where they could be a public company today, but instead chose to partner with Sage given the nature of the deal, and the opportunity to have a broader impact together.”
Many late-stage enterprise software startups have been going the IPO route, but large acquisitions in the space will also help the valuations of comparable companies.

Anthony Ha,Artificial Intelligence,"HubSpot is announcing that it has acquired Kemvi, a startup applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to help sales teams.
A few months ago, Kemvi launched DeepGraph, a product that analyzes public data so that salespeople can identify the best time (say, after a job change or the publication of an article) to reach out to potential customers. It also proactively reaches out to verify leads.
“Our vision has been to empower sales and marketing professionals by building technology that can extract information from text about what’s happening in the world,” said Kemvi founder and CEO Vedant Misra.
And from the HubSpot perspective, Chief Strategy Officer Brad Coffey said the company had been looking for new ways to bring AI technology into its platform. He acknowledged that “AI” and “machine learning” are buzzwords that get thrown around a lot right now, but he found Kemvi particularly appealing because it addressed a real need among salespeople.
“What we want to do is focus on delivering tangible value to our customers,” Coffey said. “That’s what they’re here for — they’re trying to understand the right way to grow their business and reach their customer. It’s not that we want to invest in machine learning and AI for the academic interest of it.”
The two-person Kemvi team, including Misra, will be joining HubSpot to work on bringing the startup’s technology into the HubSpot platform. Misra also said there’s a transition plan for current Kemvi/DeepGraph customers: “I think they’ll be excited for what we’re working on at HubSpot.”
The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

Ingrid Lunden,Advertising Tech,"Companies are increasingly dependent on digital platforms for their business growth, and that is giving a boost to analytics firms that are helping them make better sense of that digital landscape. SimilarWeb — which offers analytics and insights about the performance of websites and apps, as well as competitive intelligence about how other apps and sites are doing (covering 80 million websites and three million apps across more than 190 countries in all) — is today announcing a significant fundraise of $47 million. Or Offer, SimilarWeb’s CEO, said the funding will be used to continue building out its analytics, business development and acquisitions.
Offer and his CFO Jason Schwartz both said they would not comment on valuation. I understand that it is not quite double — but close to it — compared to the last round. The last round valued SimilarWeb at $400 million, so my educated guess is that this round has a post-money valuation approaching $800 million. “It’s getting close to being a unicorn,” a source close to the company said, referring to that $1 billion watermark that so many startups (or perhaps more their investors) are aiming to hit these days.
SimilarWeb — co-headquartered in San Francisco and Israel — has already made three acquisitions to date, all to expand the kinds of data that it is able to ingest and analyze. For example, at the end of 2015 it acquired Quettra to move deeper into mobile app intelligence.
This latest round was led by Viola Growth, with participation also from Saban Ventures, CE Ventures, and other unnamed investors. (Previous backers include Naspers, which led its previous round of $25 million.) It brings the total raised by SimilarWeb to $112 million. 
SimilarWeb competes against the likes of Nielsen (and in the past, Alexa, before Amazon repurposed the name and business for its voice-based assistant). On the web, it provides data about how sites are performing, and offers comparative data for other sites; it also offers insights for mobile apps, where others providing mobile analytics include App Annie, Verto Analytics and Apptopia (among many others).
In the case of the competitive market insights, the “similar” of its name is a good product/branding fit, although it actually started as a different business: its first product iteration was as a Firefox plug-in that helped you find websites that you might like to visit that were “similar” to those you were already browsing.
Despite the size of the competitive field, Offer says that SimilarWeb’s focus on deeper metrics — for example, engagement over basic traffic data — has meant that it provides businesses with a more unique set of data, and this has led to a rush of growth for the business. 
“Nielsen is still stuck in the TV age,” Offer said. “We have an amazing set of data in market research, focusing on areas like conversions and audience insights, and we think we have the data to disrupt the whole of the market research world, as old models die with the shift into digital.”
Today, the company says that more than half of all Fortune 100 companies are using its products, along with “thousands” of other CMOs, investors, analysts, marketing agencies and consultants –customers include Google, eBay, Airbnb and Staples. No information provided on how many are using free versus paid versions of its platform (SimilarWeb is built on a freemium model, where you can use SimilarWeb’s own dashboard or implement its analytics by way of an API). 
The reasons customers come to it, Offer said, are not just to help improve the performance of their own properties, but to figure out how to invest marketing budgets, how to develop their products, build bigger audiences and perhaps what acquisitions to make. 
SimilarWeb itself is taking a cue from that list to figure out how it will develop its business going forward.
As you might guess from his comments on disrupting market research, Offer noted that one area where SimilarWeb might do more in the future is consulting, where it not only provides intelligence and analytics data but also some insight into how that information can be used by the enterprise that has asked for it, to improve its business. In all, the market intelligence industry is worth some $68 billion, Offer said, so there is a lot of room to grow into adjacent areas.
“We’re excited to lead the round and support SimilarWeb’s growth towards further establishing its presence as global leader in the market intelligence industry,” said Harel Beit-On, Founder and General Partner of Viola Growth, in a statement. “SimilarWeb empowers some of the most notable global brands to better understand, grow, and track their digital market share, fueling the rapid adoption of SimilarWeb’s platform globally. With their proven technology, impressive team and global list of customers, the company is well positioned for accelerated growth and mass market penetration.”",2017-07-25,1518469,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/shutterstock_160050128.png?w=738,enterprise/,"analytics,competitive-intelligence,marketing-intelligence,similarweb",SimilarWeb raises $47M at valuation approaching $800M to take on Nielsen in digital market intel,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/similarweb-47-million/
Ingrid Lunden,Artificial Intelligence,"Big data analytics — where vast troves of information are structured and used to help businesses gain more insights into their operations and customers, to develop new products, and to run more efficiently — are a cornerstone of how many tech-centric enterprises run their businesses today. Now the focus is on building solutions that the rest of the enterprise world can use, even if the business itself is not necessarily tech-centric.
Today, an Israeli startup called Iguazio — which has built an “edge data” analytics platform targeting IoT, finance and other services that require real-time processing — is announcing that it has raised $33 million in funding to build out its service.
We understand from sources the company’s valuation is around $100 million.
Iguazio — a wordplay on Iguazu Falls, a reference to how big data is like a voluminous, fast-moving and complex waterfall — has been around since 2014, but has spent much of that time in stealth and closed beta.
It’s been a closely watched and fruitful period for the company. Iguazio has to date raised $48 million and it counts a number of its investors as beta users.
This latest Series B was led by Pitango Venture Capital, and others in the round included four strategic investors: Verizon Ventures, Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH (RBVC), trading platform CME Ventures and Dell Technologies Capital. Other previous investors (from its $15 million Series A when it was still in stealth) that participated in this round include Magma Venture Partners and Jerusalem Venture Partners (Dell was also in this first round, although that news was not made public at the time).
Each strategic investor in this latest round points to verticals where Iguazio believes its business has the potential to develop, CEO and co-founder Asaf Somekh told me in an interview.
Verizon Ventures is announcing its first investment in an Israeli startup since establishing a new operation in the country a few weeks ago; meanwhile, Verizon itself has been working on a new business unit for IoT and telematics (partly to offset competition and declining growth in fixed and consumer-mobile services). Bosch is one of the leaders in in-car systems. CME is building out its futures and options trading platforms to cover more and more data points. And Dell is, like many other hardware companies, looking for new revenue streams in services.
All four are using Iguazio’s platform in the development of their systems.
“Our investors fit very well with our direction,” Somekh said. “We are engaged with all of our investors to some degree.” He added that while there are no revenues yet, for the last year and a half “we have been working with companies and are on the verge of the first generally available product that will come out in a matter of weeks.”
The idea behind what Iguazio is doing is that it’s trying to provide a platform for businesses to engage with big data analytics in a way that will actually produce results with minimal headaches.
Somekh cites Gartner research that found that only one out of every 10 big data analytics projects in enterprises succeeds because of the lack of complexity and skills in the business to deploy and run them.
“As one of the largest telecom companies in the world, we witness the importance of real-time continuous analytics and the way it has become crucial across businesses. Yet, there are not many existing scalable solutions,” said Merav Rotem-Naaman, Managing Director at Verizon Ventures Israel, in a statement.
“Iguazio is aiming to become a trusted partner for companies looking to use data to make real-time business decisions that improve security and operations. IoT data that improves decision-making and transforms business must get analyzed closer to the edge, whether it be a fleet of trucks or the monetization of mobile usage.”
While there are a lot of big data analytics services on the market today, Iguazio’s unique selling point is that it offers its services at the ‘edge’ — that is, close to the point where processing is taking place.
For services in areas like the Internet of Things, this is an essential component of how these networks will develop: cloud-based processing can become too costly when you have a vast network of end points, and at the same time, the end points themselves do not necessarily have the processing power to crunch their own numbers, let alone those of other end points from across the rest of the network.
Edge computing is an area that a number of other companies are looking at to offload some of the processing from the origination point and the cloud. Recall Cisco and IBM’s deal last year to integrate IBM’s Watson AI analytics into Cisco’s edge routers. Others in the same area as Iguazio include the startup MapR, which already has products out in the market and today — possibly coincidentally, possibly on purpose to coincide with Iguazio’s news — rolled out a new program where systems integrators can work with MapR enterprises on big data deployments.
Iguazio’s approach — providing a platform that makes using big data analytics simple for any kind of business, whether technical or not — falls in line with another trend that we’ve been noticing. If areas like big data analytics and artificial intelligence represent the next wave of computing, there has been a rush of startups coming out of the gates that are focusing on building ways to make that next wave more accessible.
Others in this vein include LiveStories, which is building a data ingestion, analytics, and visualization platform specifically aimed at civic organizations that might otherwise lack the in-house ability to do this kind of work themselves. Element AI, meanwhile, is ambitiously building an “incubator” aimed at both smaller startups that touch one of the many aspects of AI, and enterprises that want to have better access to that tech, to help them meet somewhere in the middle. Like Iguazio, both have raised funding in recent weeks to build out their services to meet demand.
Notably, the founding team at Iguazio have a strong history when it comes to building tech companies and exiting them. Another co-founder is Yaron Segev, who started and ran flash storage company XtremIO, which sold in 2012 for $430 million to data storage giant EMC. (Dell’s investment here comes via the EMC connection.)
“Iguazio’s team has an outstanding track record of innovation and execution and we are delighted to back these stellar managers once again,” said Eyal Niv, Managing General Partner at Pitango, in a statement. “While the majority of big data deployments fail due to over complexity, iguazio’s platform has proven to be simple, fast and secure, making it exceptional for artificial intelligence and machine learning use cases. We’ve already received overwhelming feedback from beta customers generating actionable real-time insights with significant business impact.”",2017-07-25,1518461,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2408914515_137086b28d_o.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,"pitango-venture-capital,iguazio,edge-computing,big-data","Iguazio nabs $33M to bring big data edge analytics to IoT, finance and other enterprises",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/iguazio-nabs-33m-to-bring-big-data-analytics-to-iot-finance-and-other-enterprises/
Jordan Crook,Enterprise,"Restaurant owners have a lot of responsibilities and a wide array of skills to handle those responsibilities. That said, building a website isn’t usually within that skill-set.
That’s where BentoBox comes in.
The company, which helps restaurant owners quickly build full-featured websites for their restaurants, has just closed a $4.8 million Series A funding round. The round was led by Bullpen Capital, with participation from Launch Capital, Seamless founders Jason Finger and Paul Appelbaum, RiverPark Ventures, and Invision CEO Clark Valberg, alongside existing seed investors Armory Square Ventures, Female Founders Fund, Freshsource Capital and Golden Seeds.
BentoBox offers restauranteurs a platform with highly customizable templates for websites. The service also includes plug-and-play features for adding and updating menus, reservation integration with platforms like OpenTable, catering transactions, and more. BentoBox is also mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, and offers the option to integrate digital and physical gift cards, sell tickets to events, and handle deposits and contracts.
While there are plenty of website builders out there, like Wix and Squarespace, BentoBox promises that restaurant owners won’t have to hire someone to continually update the website or add new features or widgets, as the entire CMS is code-free. Plus, the BentoBox-powered sites are highly customizable, meaning that restauranteurs who prioritize design and style within their physical space can bring that same look and feel over to their website.
Thus far, BentoBox has processed over $1 million in transactions for its restaurant clients, of which there are more than 1,200 throughout the world.
As the company adds more and more features, it is also continually tweaking pricing, but founder and CEO Krystle Mobayeni says that pricing can range between $100 and $500 per month.
The new funding will go toward marketing and expanding the sales team, as well as development of a new marketing tool for clients.",2017-07-24,1517931,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/bentobox-cafe-platform-website.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,bentobox,"BentoBox, the website builder for restauranteurs, cooks up $4.8M Series A",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/bentobox-the-website-builder-for-restauranteurs-cooks-up-4-8m-series-a/
Frederic Lardinois,Earnings,"Following its longstanding tradition of reporting quarterly earnings for its fourth financial quarter of the year in July, Microsoft today announced non-GAAP revenue of $24.7 billion and GAAP earnings per share of $0.83 (and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.98) for the last three months. Operating income was $7.0 billion non-GAAP.
Wall Street expected revenues of around $24.3 billion, which was pretty aggressive to begin with given that this called for a 7 percent year-over-year growth. As for earnings per share, Wall Street’s crystal ball readers called for $0.71 — or a 3 percent year-over-year growth.
Clearly, Wall Street didn’t do a good job with its predictions, but Microsoft had a great quarter. Unsurprisingly, its stock is up after the earnings release.
As usual, all eyes are on how Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform performed. While Azure’s growth has slowed down a tiny bit over the last few quarters (and we’re still talking close to 100 percent annual growth), it’s one of the main drivers of Microsoft’s top-line growth. In the last quarter, Microsoft reported $6.8 billion in revenue for its “Intelligent Cloud” business (which includes more than just Azure) and said its annual cloud run rate was $15.2 billion. This quarter, this area delivered revenues of $7.4 billion (up 11 percent from last year) and the commercial cloud annualized run rate is now up to 18.9 billion.

“Innovation across our cloud platforms drove strong results this quarter,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft, in a canned statement. “Customers are looking to Microsoft and our thriving partner ecosystem to accelerate their own digital transformations and to unlock new opportunity in this era of intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.”
Additional highlights here are a 15 percent growth in server products and cloud services and Azure growing at a more than healthy 97 percent year-over-year (with Azure compute usage also doubling from last year).
Microsoft also said that its installed base for its Enterprise Mobility product has now hit more than 50 million.
Microsoft’s gross margins in this area also got a healthy boost. After the release, Stephanie Rodriguez, Microsoft’s Director of Investor Relations, told me that that she sees two drivers for this: the introduction and customer adoption of higher-value services and Microsoft’s ability to improve its own efficiencies as its product portfolio gains scale. “This was a really big quarter for us in terms of our commercial base,” she told me. “What we saw was increased customer commitment to commercial cloud and really great renewals.”
In the last quarter, Microsoft’s More Personal Computing segment took a hit because the company sold significantly fewer Surface devices than in previous quarters. Over the last few months, Microsoft launched a number of new devices, including a new Surface Pro and its first real laptop. These didn’t go on sale until late in the quarter, though. Analysts expected about $8.61 billion in sales for this segment and Microsoft delivered $8.8 billion, down 2 percent.
The reason for this, Microsoft argues, is lower phone revenue (“phone revenue was immaterial and declined $361 million,” Microsoft writes), though this was offset by growth in search, Windows and gaming revenue. The number of Xbox Live active users is holding steady at about 53 million and search revenue grew 10 percent year-over-year (likely driven by the integration of Bing into Windows 10).
Office 365 and the rest of Microsoft’s productivity tools have also long been a fast-growing segment for the company. This quarter, Microsoft reported revenue of $8.4 billion (up 21 percent) for this area. In our conversation, Rodriguez noted that Office 365 now also has 27 million customers on the consumer side.
LinkedIn revenue was also up in the last quarter and went from $975 million in Q3 to $1.065 billion in the last quarter.",2017-07-20,1516981,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/microsoft-earnings.jpg?w=738,enterprise/,earnings,Microsoft earnings beat expectations thanks to strong cloud performance,microsoft,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/20/microsoft-earnings-beat-expectations-thanks-to-strong-cloud-performance/
Frederic Lardinois,Cloud,"Google today announced that TCP BBR, a new congestion-control algorithm that it has used to improve network throughput from google.com and YouTube by about four percent globally (and by more than 14 percent in some countries), is now also available to its Cloud Platform users.
The general idea here is to improve on the existing congestion-control algorithms for internet traffic, which have been around since the 1980s and which typically only take packet loss into account (when networking buffers fill up, routers will discard any new packets). These algorithms decide how fast a given device should be sending data into the network to avoid overloading it. When these systems realize that some of the data packets don’t make it to their final destination, they start sending the data more slowly, which ideally reduces the amount of congestion. There are all kinds of algorithms for working out the details of how exactly to do this (and how to speed up again over time), but at their core, they all tend to follow the same patterns.

BBR, which stands for “Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time,” takes a different approach. It doesn’t just look at packet loss but also at how fast the network is actually delivering data. “For a given network connection, it uses recent measurements of the network’s delivery rate and round-trip time to build an explicit model that includes both the maximum recent bandwidth available to that connection, and its minimum recent round-trip delay,” Google explains. Using this data, BBR then decides how fast it wants to send its data.
The result of this is an algorithm that can send more data at any given time (without incurring losses), especially on long-haul links. Google says one of its benchmarks showed a 2,700x increase in throughput rate, but that’s obviously an edge case and a synthetic benchmark.
The company first publicly talked about BBR in a paper last year and has since open-sourced the protocol. Google has also contributed it to the Linux kernel TCP stack.

Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"Gizmo maker Apple just launched its official Instagram account, @apple. But this isn’t your average corporate account as the company doesn’t want to showcase its own product ad nauseam. Instead, Apple is going to share photos shot with an iPhone.
In many ways, this Instagram account feels like the natural extension of the “Shot on iPhone” billboard ad campaign. Without showing the iPhone, Apple is promoting the iPhone camera as the perfect tool if you want to up your game on Instagram.
Every year, there are more than a trillion photos taken on various iPhones. Chances are that there are people in every corner of the world currently using an iPhone to shoot a unique photo or video. So Apple wants to leverage that and showcase the creativity and diversity of iPhone users.
Based on the first posts, curators working for @apple find some photos captured with an iPhone, ask the creator if they can share them and repost them on the company’s account. Apple isn’t taking any photo itself.
There are a few interesting things with the account. First, Apple relies heavily on the recently introduced gallery format to showcase five creators at a time. You can find them on Instagram by reading the captions.
Second, the company is using videos to share a few photos at a time, add sound effects and interview the creators — those sound bites remind me of Humans of New York. Apple is also sharing Instagram stories with the same format.
Third, Apple uses the #ShotoniPhone hashtag in the account description and below each post. It’s clear that the company wants to encourage people to use the hashtag so that it becomes a pop culture symbol. Many popular Instagram accounts use this method to resurface popular posts as well, such as @ihavethisthingwithfloors.
This isn’t Apple’s first Instagram account — @applemusic currently has 2.2 million followers. I’ve also seen Apple ads for Apple Music and the Apple Watch on Instagram. But it’s interesting to see Apple creating an “Instagram-native” account.

Natasha Lomas,Apps,"Honeydue is a mobile app that aims to reduce money-related arguments between couples by offering tools to share information on respective account balances and spending.
The app also lets couples stay on top of money matters in other ways, such as being able to comment on individual transactions and manage bill reminders together — so they can, in the words of co-founder Eugene Park, “be on the same page” about money.
“My co-founder, Thien Tran, and I are pretty passionate about personal finance and helping others develop better financial habits and literacy,” Park tells TechCrunch, explaining how the idea for the app came about.
“When we started this project both [of us] were living with our partners and arguing, from time to time, with our partners about money. And it sort of hit us — with all of these basic tools that are out, there if couples like us can’t get on the same page with money then these tools really don’t matter.”
The target user is typically in the Millennial age-range — with Park noting there are some 32M Millennials now living with a partner. “We believe all of them should be co-managing their money together and certainly co-developing their financial literacy habits together,” he says.
The founders surveyed 600 couples to help spec out the app’s feature set, and the research threw up a few surprises — such as how much demand there was for a bill reminder facility. Sixty per cent of users who sign up to use the app now create at least one bill reminder during the onboarding process, according to Park.
“We were shocked,” he says of this appetite for bill reminders. “We thought, maybe it’s because we live in this Bay Area bubble where everything’s being auto-paid, but why do people want bill reminders?
“[W]e took a deep dive into it and I think the narrative that’s emerging is… 75 per cent of Americans generally are living paycheck to paycheck. And are having to make a very difficult decision of which bill to pay. And for that reason that’s why they’re not autopaying it.”
“The top four banks in this country are charging $6.4BN in bank fees — whether they’re late fees or overdraft fees — and so I have to imagine, I don’t any data to prove this, that that money is coming from some of the most vulnerable parts of our culture,” he continues.
“And so these folks, they’re very sensitive to two things: one is the actual timing of when to pay their bills. And two, their account balances so that they don’t go under certain minimums that result in monthly fees.”
The team also found the most used existing application for couples to manage their finances together is spreadsheets — hence spying an opportunity to build something better.
“If financial literacy is bad in this country, spreadsheet literacy is almost as bad,” says Park. “18 per cent of couples that we surveyed are using spreadsheets. And it was 3x over any other app or service. And so we’re setting out to build a better alternative to these spreadsheets that couples are co-managing.”
“If nothing else we’re automatically updating your balances and activity, whereas a spreadsheet can’t do that,” he adds.
A key friction point the app aims to address is to enable users to choose how much information they share.
“One of the hesitation points that we saw in a lot of the couples was that they didn’t necessary want to argue about the little things,” he explains. “Did you take Uber vs Lyft, The number one argument we read in a study was over frivolous purchases. So a lot of couples said that they want to goal set and plan but they don’t necessarily want to argue about did they make frivolous purchases. So one of the features we allow you to is we allow you to track your account balances but choose what you want to share.
“So you can choose which accounts you want to share, you can choose whether you just want to share the balance only. Or whether you also want to share activity and transactions as well.”
“We looked at… existing tools like Mint.com and others, and they are generally not collaborative in nature,” he adds. “One of the friction points for a lot of couples is choosing what they want to share with each other. Choosing how much of their finances that they want to delegate vs collaborate on.”
The Honeydue app soft launched on iOS in late January and Android in March. They have around 20,000 registered users at this point. The app is currently US-only.
“We skew female, I believe it’s 60 per cent. Which makes us relatively unique relative to other personal finance apps,” he adds.
“What’s interesting is from a generational perspective and a behavioral perspective we’re seeing that Millennials are more likely to co-manage their finances together as opposed to my parents generation, my generation (X).
“So we did a survey of 600 couples and 75% reported that they co-manage some to all of their finances together so that is generally our target market: People that are committed to sharing financial responsibility as well as financial literacy with each other.”
Users are typically using the app to connect and share their bank account balances — which is what the team considers “our core use-case and our core pitch/value proposition” — although, interestingly, couples still choose not to share information on a portion of their accounts.
“What’s interesting is that approximately 60 per cent of accounts are shared at some level but 40 per cent are not,” notes Park. “And so couples that are signing up for our app are exercising that privacy and autonomy.”
Another “interesting use-case” that’s emerged for the app is a feature called “what’s that charge?” — which lets users query each other about individual transactions.
“What we were noticing is that a lot of couples, before we built this app, they were looking at their bank statements and whenever they saw a transaction that they didn’t recognize they would screenshot it in a mobile app and then they would MMS it to their partners and ask do you recognize this charge? And that loop was regular, was repeatedly regularly and we just thought that was so silly, so we made it easier for partners to identify these transactions and share them or ask their partner what’s that charge?
“So we added a comment section under each transaction as well as an emoticon button. So you can flag transactions, you can express shock to a transaction with your partner or thumbs up support. We’re seeing a good number of couples that are using that on a regular basis, so that’s another common use-case.”
Another feature that’s proving popular aims to help couples who are trying to budget together — by allowing them to see their spending autonomically categorized.
Bill splitting (or “sharing” in the app’s language) is also supported, although Park says this turned out to be less popular than the founders thought it would be, with only around 5 per cent os users making use of it.
There’s no native payment facility within the app itself either — if couples need to settle an IOY between each other Honeydue links out to PayPal or Venmo to do the actual moving of money.
“Once you’re getting into the business of helping people move money then we expose ourselves to another level of scrutiny,” adds Park.
Currently, the app supports integrating with around 9,000 of the biggest banks in the US, via its data provider — which he describes as “pretty broad coverage of the most popular banks”.
“Like other personal finance tools we go through one of three major financial data providers. Generally the way it works is when you enter your credentials, it’s validated with the bank and they provide us with a token and we store that token and with that token we can’t do anything other than look up your balance and your transactions. and keep them up to date.“
In terms of business model, the app is free to use — which does of course bring up the question of how they intend to monetize the visibility they’re gaining into users’ bank accounts and spending habits.
And while Park couches the privacy policy and terms of service as “pretty restrictive” — saying, “in generally we’re not allowed to sell your data to anyone, similar to Mint.com and Credit Karma” — the eventual plan is to “offer our users offers”, so they will be using income and transaction/spending data to support custom marketing of other financial services, down the line, taking a cut of any services sales as their commission.
“Essentially we want to help guide our users to better financial products and services that we think will save them money, and we will use your data to help tailor some of these offers to you, without compromising your identity to third parties,” he says, adding: “It’s not at the top of our roadmap but in some point in order to keep it free we’ll start testing that.”

Devin Coldewey,Social,"Airbnb may have put its foot in its mouth before when it comes to communicating the benefits it brings to cities, but it’s hard to argue with raw, uncut science. A new study from the Internet Association, a trade group comprising many online properties including Airbnb, takes a hard look at housing stats in Seattle and bats away a few issues commonly brought up regarding the service.
One criticism that appears repeatedly, especially in fast-growing cities where gentrification and developers are roundly resented, is that people are buying up housing units just to rent them on Airbnb. It’s simpler and more profitable than long-term rental, and there’s less paperwork — but of course, it could limit housing options for people that, you know, actually live somewhere.
While Airbnb maintains that only a small number of units being rented in Seattle are of this type, multi-unit hosts are the fastest growing category for the area, according to a study of data from 2015 and 2016.
The city conducted its own review of Airbnb data and found that a quarter of the full homes available for rent on the service are not the host’s primary residence. And Inside Airbnb, which tracks rental data in various cities, suggests the numbers may be even higher than that.
When asked for comment, Airbnb didn’t dispute the preceding numbers exactly, but cautioned that the data and methods vary widely, so any analysis (including its own, really) should be examined in context. For example, Inside Airbnb calls any home available for more than 60 days “high availability,” though that’s within the normal range by the company’s reckoning.
The IA study tackled the multi-unit host criticism by looking for correlations between short-term rentals (STRs) and owner occupancy of housing. The logic is that if Airbnb and other services promote this type of behavior — multiple homes or units being used exclusively as STRs — you’d expect to see a relationship there. The researchers also looked at investment mortgages, the kind of loans you’d take on if you were looking to make a business out of a few cheap homes in your area.
That doesn’t seem to be the case, according to the stats the IA parsed. Chart time:
“Our findings suggest that STRs help Seattleites stay in their homes,” the IA’s Chief Economist and author of the paper, Christopher Hooton, told TechCrunch. “Investment mortgages do not spike because of short-term rental activity. In fact, they are negatively correlated. Nor does owner occupancy decrease or rents increase.”
So while there will likely always be a few examples of this kind of digital property portfolio, it seems that there just isn’t enough of it to have a major effect on rent and housing availability. Other factors in a growing city like Seattle, such as the gazillion ugly, expensive new apartment buildings they’re putting in all over the place, are likely a much greater influence.
(I’m going to be priced out of my place soon in no small part because it’s spitting distance from Amazon HQ. People are happy to pay extortionate rents when they only intend to stay in the city for two years.)
In any case, proposed rules from the city (currently inching their way through the usual red tape) would limit hosts to renting out a total of two units. That would act as an effective damper on multi-unit operations, and if Airbnb’s own spin on this topic (this report included) is taken at face value, the company shouldn’t really care, since it claims very few users are in that commercial class.
“The vast majority of our hosts in Seattle are sharing the home in which they live to earn a little extra money,” the company said in a statement. “Hosts with multiple entire home listings make up a small fraction of our community. We’re committed to being good partners with the City of Seattle and are working with city leaders to craft short-term rental regulations that will protect long-term housing stock and allow Seattle families to share their homes.”
The other issue looked at by the IA study is the idea that STRs are interfering with the hotel business. It’s kind of hard to sympathize with the incumbent industry here, but at the same time we want to avoid a situation like Uber’s in which a challenger is mainly competitive because it is cutting corners at every possible opportunity to undercut its opponents. So it’s good to put eyes on potential problem areas like this.
The study shows that there’s actually very little geographical overlap between hotels and home rentals, and this tallies with common sense: are you really going to try to compete with the Marriott on its home turf? No, you rent your neat spot in “scenic” West Seattle for much less and because there are so few hotel options there.
You can see that in this rather strangely colored-in map:
The Seattle rules would also require hosts to get a business license and a city-issued Short Term Rental Operator’s License; proof would also have to be provided that the units to be rented are the host’s primary or secondary residence, that they are up to code, and that basic safety information is available to renters.
Airbnb calls these “unnecessary, complicated barriers to entry,” but they sound like good ideas to me. It’s not like you have to report to the city every time you rent to someone — you just need to get on the radar and show you’re meeting some basic standards. The license and income information would also reduce the government’s total reliance on rental platforms for that data. Plus, you know, taxes.
Like so many new business models, home-sharing presents powerful opportunities to users and unique challenges to businesses and regulators. Different cities require different handling of such things, and New York’s law may differ from Seattle’s greatly but be no less tailored to its own needs. The next couple years will make for something of a global experiment as various methods of regulating short-term rentals (to say nothing of ride-sharing and other “sharing economy” options) and the results should be fascinating — though perhaps more so for users and regulators than the companies affected.",2017-08-06,1523735,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/airbnb-sea.png?w=738,social/,"sharing-economy,home-sharing",Seattle study puts down some common criticisms of Airbnb-style renting as regulations loom,airbnb,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/06/seattle-study-puts-down-some-common-criticisms-of-airbnb-style-renting-as-regulations-loom/
Darrell Etherington,Apps,"Google is creating a visual publication format for media companies similar to Snapchat’s “Discover,” based on its AMP mobile optimization technology for webpages and called “Stamp,” according to a new Wall Street Journal report.
The program is said to be announced as soon as next week, and could include a range of publishing partners including Vox, CNN, The Washington Post and more. The “Stamp” name is said to be a portmanteau of AMP, and “St” from “Stories,” the report claims, which is a term commonly used now for one-to-many short form expiring visual content among social service providers, including Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram.
The WSJ describes the product as offering slideshows composed of “swipeable slides” incorporating text as well as photos and videos, which is basically what you get out of Snap’s own Discover stories in Snapchat. Stamp stories would be available broadly on the mobile web, and surfaced directly in Google search results, which could help considerably in terms of increasing their appeal vs. platform-specific products like Discover that require a user to already be within a specific app.
It sounds like we’re likely to hear more about this sooner rather than later in terms of official details.",2017-08-04,1523732,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/snapchat-discover-scroll.gif?w=640,social/,,Google said to launch AMP-based Snapchat Discover-like feature,"snapchat,google",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/04/google-said-to-launch-amp-based-snapchat-discover-like-feature/
Sarah Perez,Social,"Facebook is testing a new way to “go live” on its social network – an option that was previously available by pressing the “Live” button on the Status update box. Now, for some users, the ability to “go live” – meaning start a live video broadcast – is appearing right within the Facebook Camera screen, alongside other options, like the ability to use Facebook Live Audio, or create a GIF.
Live streaming on Facebook was a feature first introduced back in 2015, initially only for public figures and celebrities. It later rolled out to regular Facebook users via the company’s iOS and Android applications, and, at the beginning of this year, to the desktop.
With the growing popularity of podcasts, Facebook later also added a Live Audio feature, designed largely for publishers and authors, who use it for things like news radio-like shows, book readings, and other audio-only broadcasts.
But you can’t “go live” from the Facebook Camera today, which actually seems a little odd.
It makes sense to combine all camera-related functions on just one screen, as this test is doing. That includes taking a personal photo or video to share on Facebook, using photo filters, making a GIF (another option still in testing), or recording live audio and live video.
For those who are seeing the new version of Facebook Camera, the different functions are appearing across the top of the screen under tabs that read “Live,” “Normal,” and “GIF.”
When you’re on the “Live” tab, you can tap on an icon of a video camera to live stream video, or tap on a microphone icon to just stream audio.

What’s more, the new feature also offers you the option to go live just in your Facebook Story, as opposed to sharing your live video in a regular Facebook post. Or you can “go live” both in your Facebook Story and post at the same time.
This is available from a drop-down menu that appears, where you can also choose your audience for the live recording – like Friends, a particular friends list, or Public, for example.
This “Live Facebook Story” option is basically Facebook’s version of the Instagram Live feature introduced last winter.
Facebook Live Stories were recently spotted in the wild, too:
Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that this is a test for the time being, and the feature hasn’t been fully rolled out to Facebook users.
The company also recently began testing Facebook Stories on the desktop web, but is planning that feature’s public launch soon.",2017-08-04,1523654,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fb-live-background-main.jpg?w=738,social/,"stories,facebook-stories,facebook-live","Facebook tests ‘going live’ from Facebook Camera, Live Stories like Instagram",facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/04/facebook-tests-going-live-from-facebook-camera-live-stories-like-instagram/
Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"Snap Inc desperately needs ad revenue to redirect its sinking share price. So after a year of getting mercilessly copied by Facebook, Snapchat is returning the favor by launching its take on the Facebook ads Power Editor. This new “Advanced Mode” for its Snapchat Ads Manager lets big advertisers rapidly deploy complex ad campaigns with tons of creative variants.
By allowing big ad agencies and brands to efficiently target, test and update their ad campaigns, they may be willing to spend more money on Snap. While the benefits won’t kick in in time for Snap’s pivotal Q2 earnings call next week, Advanced Mode could help the upstart put a dent in the Google/Facebook ad duopoly down the line.

Snap launched its self-serve Ads Manager in May, and added vertical video creation tool Snap Publisher in July. With the addition of Advanced Mode, advertisers will be able to:
Snap also got an ads boost today that has perked up its share price when the world’s largest ad agency WPP’s CEO Martin Sorrell told CNBC that WPP was doubling its Snap ad buy from $100 million in 2016 to $200 million in 2017. Though he contextualized that, noting that WPP will spend $2 billion on Facebook ads this year, and had previously told online video news channel Cheddar about the increased buy.
Facebook debuted its Power Editor in 2011 (which I covered the launch of because I’ve been doing this forever). It was the last piece of its ads suite that started with direct ad sales, then self-serve ads and then a self-serve API. Snap launched direct ad sales in 2014, then an Ads API in 2016, before testing its self-serve tool in May, and now launching Advanced Mode.
 
The similarities in strategy aren’t too surprising considering Snap’s first COO Emily White was recruited from Facebook-owned Instagram, and it later hired Facebook Audience Network head Sriram Krishnan to work on its ad tools.
These Advanced Mode tools could help Snapchat get to the ad load and scale necessary to monetize its slow-growing audience. If it can’t add tens of millions of new users per quarter, Wall Street will want it to prove it can earn a higher average revenue per user. That means squeezing as much money as it can from each user with these improved ad targeting options.
While Facebook might be running Snap’s product playbook, Snap is making progress by running Facebook’s monetization playbook.",2017-08-04,1523643,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/snapchat-ads.png?w=738,social/,"snapchat-ads,snap-inc",Now it’s Snapchat copying Facebook’s ads Power Editor,"facebook,snapchat",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/04/snapchat-advanced-mode/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Nerdy Google has failed at social time and time again, so it considered buying teen sensation Snapchat. The search giant held informal talks with Snap and floated an offer of $30 billion in 2016 before Snap’s last funding round, and just before its IPO this year, according to Business Insider’s Alex Heath. That offer was apparently an open secret inside Snap, and was on the table after the IPO, too.
But Snap’s notoriously independent CEO Evan Spiegel has apparently showed no interest in selling out to Google or anyone else. That’s despite the startup’s market cap slipping to around $15 billion after soaring as high as $30 billion when it IPO’d in May.
News of Google’s interest helped Snap’s share price climb around 2.3 percent today. The uptick comes after weeks of decline due to lockup expiration finally allowing insiders to sell stock, and strong growth for Facebook’s Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status clones of Snapchat.
Google declined to comment to Business Insider and Snap told TechCrunch “these rumors are false.” It’s possible that Google’s interest was very preliminary, and likely never rose to Snap’s higher ranks. It’s standard for startups to explore alternative paths before taking significant funding rounds or going public.
[Update: Now Google is building its own competitor to Snapchat Discover. Read more in our feature piece: “Google and Facebook envision Stories for news, not social“]
Google’s growth-stage investment fund CapitalG ended up investing in Snap after the 2016 talks went nowhere, contributing to the round valuing the “camera company” at $20 billion. The organizations have long been buddy-buddy. Google chairman Eric Schmidt was an adviser to Spiegel, Snap runs Google’s office software suite and Snapchat has committed to spending $2 billion on Google Cloud hosting over the next five years.
At the time of the May 2016 choice to go with raising money instead of being acquired, Snap looked unchallenged in the full-screen Stories social media game. But in August, Instagram’s soon to be wildly successful Stories clone launched, which has diverted growth, mind share and advertisers from Snap ever since.

Joining forces could be beneficial to both companies. Google would get a top social property to make up for its Google+, Buzz and Wave flops. It could also reap data about people’s social graphs, where they spend time and what topics they care about, allowing it to improve its ad targeting and measurement.
Snap would gain a deep-pocketed parent that could provide extra capital to make acquisitions and build out its R&D-heavy augmented reality technology. Machine vision and image recognition algorithms from Google Search could unlock information about what’s in everyone’s Snaps. Google’s advertising expertise and connections could boost Snap’s ad revenue.
Together, they could align their Google Glass and Snap Spectacles hardware efforts to build a powerful but appealing AR device. However, Google’s open, engineering-driven culture could clash with Snap’s secretive, design-driven culture.

But Spiegel is the real stumbling block. He and his co-founder Bobby Murphy have configured Snap’s voting rights to give them full control over the direction of the company, denying public backers any say. So even if investors would love to take the $30 billion offer that’s double Snap’s current market cap, they couldn’t compel it to do so. Spiegel famously rebuked Mark Zuckerberg’s offers to buy Snapchat, and is known for following his gut over outside advice.
As we wrote before the IPO, to bet on Snap is to bet on Spiegel — for better or worse. His sixth sense for product produced ephemeral messaging and Stories, while his eye for acquisitions gave Snap Bitmoji and AR face filters. But with Snap drowning under Facebook’s competition, Spiegel’s renegade style could see the company refuse life preservers even as it sinks.",2017-08-03,1523323,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/google-acquire-snapchat.png?w=738,social/,"evan-spiegel,snap",Google reportedly offered $30 billion to acquire Snapchat,"alphabet,google",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/google-buy-snap/
Sarah Perez,Social,"Great news, folks. Facebook Stories, the shameless Snapchat clone that sits above the News Feed on Facebook’s mobile app, is now rolling out to Facebook’s desktop site. Here, the Stories feature is no longer at the top of the page, but is instead off to the right side, where it’s at least a bit less intrusive. A small question mark icon appears in the Stories module, as well, which will explain the feature’s purpose, when hovered over with your cursor.
The explanation simply states that Stories consist of photos and video that are visible for 24 hours before they disappear.
Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch the Stories launch on desktop is still considered a test, but notes that a wider rollout is expected soon.
The company chose to bring Stories to Facebook, after seeing its success on Instagram, where Stories had debuted in summer 2016.

With the first five months, Instagram Stories soared to 150 million daily users. It now has 250 million daily users, compared with Snapchat’s 166 million. Half of the businesses on Instagram created a story in the past month, Facebook also announced this week, and Instagram’s average usage has climbed to 32 minutes per day for those under 25, and 24 minutes per day for those 25 and up, it said.
The feature arrived on Facebook at the beginning of 2017, initially in Ireland before expanding to other countries, including the U.S.
The company has credited Snapchat with pioneering the visual communication format, but believes the pivot into Stories goes beyond simply copying a competitor’s popular app. Like Facebook’s News Feed – a format that went on to become the standard across social apps – Stories are a new way to share. That’s led to the format being broadly adopted across the industry.
Facebook itself has added Stories to Instagram, Messenger, and its flagship app. It even tried a Stories-like feature in WhatsApp. Elsewhere, Stories is inspiring redesigns of other top apps, including most recently, Tinder, Match, and Skype.
However, on Facebook, the feature hasn’t seen as much traction.
In fact, there were so few people using Stories on Facebook’s mobile app, that the company in April began to display grayed-out icons of your most frequently contacted friends instead of blank spaces in the Stories feature that no one much was using.
It’s unclear that bringing Facebook Stories to the desktop web will impact its usage significantly. Perhaps, after all, there are only so many places users want to post this sort of ephemeral content, and for the time being, people have chosen Instagram. It makes one wonder at which point Facebook will acknowledge this, and choose to swap in or sync Instagram stories to Facebook’s Stories feature instead.
Facebook hasn’t yet confirmed what percentage of users are seeing Stories on the desktop, but it’s not broadly available. However, we are aware of users seeing the module outside the U.S.",2017-08-03,1523125,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fb-stories-desktop1.png?w=738,social/,facebook-stories,Facebook begins testing Stories on the desktop,"snapchat,facebook",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/facebook-begins-testing-stories-on-the-desktop/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"At first glance, YC-backed Muzmatch‘s dating app might look best described as a ‘Tinder for Muslims’. But co-founders Shahzad Younas and Ryan Brodie are clear about what sets their target audience apart from the casual dating/hook-up crowd: a genuine intent to find a partner in order to get married.
Which is why, they say, they’re definitely not just cloning Tinder for Muslims.
“Our audience is super captivated, they’re so invested in this search,” says Brodie. “For a Muslim in their twenties, their upbringing has been so centered to find a husband or wife. And that is for most Muslims. I think some people think it’s just like JCrush for Jews. But it’s totally not about that from where we stand.
“Not just market size — we’re more than 100 times larger market than the Jewish market, for example — but the real difference is the seriousness and intent. It’s not casual dating. In Islam there’s a concept where… you’re only ever going to be half way there without your spouse. So this is how central it is. This is where almost all our users come at it from.”
Some two years after the launch of the first version of the app, Muzmatch has around 200,000 users, spread across ~160 countries, and is growing around 10 per cent, month on month, according to the co-founders.
“We’ve had weddings across the world,” says Younas. “Right now about 30 people a day are leaving our app and telling us specifically I found my partner on your app or I just got engaged or we just got married.”

Growth thus far has coming organically, via word-of-mouth recommendations in the Muslim community, they say. Around half of Muzmatch users are in the UK; around a third are in the US and Canada; with the rest spread all over the world. Gender wise, roughly two-thirds of are male, and one-third is female. The average age is mid to late twenties.
The founders say the matchmaking app has led to around 6,000 couples getting together so far — and “at least 600 confirmed weddings” — although they can’t be sure the number isn’t higher as not everyone messages them with their stories.
They tell a funny story about how they were emailed by a man from Uganda thanking them for helping him meet his wife via the app — and when they went to check exactly how many users they had in Uganda it was, well, just those two. “When it’s meant to be, it is meant to be!” says Younas.
Despite a few ‘rest of world’ successes to point to, their current “concentrated focus” is on Muslims in the West — tackling what they describe as the “key problem” for this 60-million community: “low density of Muslims”. Which means that Muslim singles searching for a partner of the same faith in towns and cities in places like the UK, US and Canada are likely to face a shortage of potential mates. At least in their immediate vicinity.
These dynamics work in Muzmatch’s favor, reckons Brodie, because their target market is already geared up to putting in extra work to find ‘the one’. And is also therefore likely to appreciate a tech tool that helps make their search easier.
“What’s great for us is there’s already an expectation of movement, so we’ve never had to worry about the network effect. Most dating apps, every user expects to meet the one a mile down the road — luckily for us, that expectation isn’t there, which is brilliant,” he tells TechCrunch.
Another advantage of addressing such an engaged user base, according to the founders, is Muzmatch’s singles are incentivized to fill out their profiles with lots of detailed information — given how many criteria can be at play as part of their search (i.e. over and above just whether they find a potential partner attractive, and relating to other factors such as family, culture, tradition, religious level and so on) — and the app can then utilize all this rich user data for improving its suggested matches.
“With our app, and with the technology in the app, we’re really trying to cater to those specific needs,” says Younas, describing the difficulties Muslims in the West can have meeting a person who meets all their criteria. “We think that conventional Western dating apps don’t really cater to this.”
The business is already profitable, taking revenue including via premium subscriptions and in-app purchases which offer users additional features, such as the ability to be matched with someone before they’ve liked you (as a way to try to get their attention) — though it’s free to join and use the basic app.
“Because there’s a more serious intent, people are more willing to spend vs… a casual dating app — where the expectation is almost free,” argues Younas.
And while Muzmatch’s feature-set has some basic mechanisms that would be familiar to any Tinder user, like the ability to ‘like’ or ‘pass’ on a possible match, and the ability to chat in-app with mutual matches, it also has differences that reflect the needs of its community — which Younas describes as being “essentially” without a casual dating market, as a result of marriage being “such a big part of our faith”.
So, for example, all users have to take a selfie via the app so their profile can be manually verified to help boost trust and keep out spammers; users don’t have to provide their real name though, and can choose not to display photos on their profiles or blur photos unless there’s an active match.
Users are also asked to rate others they have interacted with — and these ratings are fed into the matching algorithm, with the aim of surfacing “quality users” and promoting positive behaviors that mesh well with a community of singles that’s typically really serious about finding a life partner.
Female users can also opt for a chaperoning feature whereby all of their in-app chats are emailed to a wali/guardian, should they wish to observe this type of Islamic etiquette.
There are a few other differences in how males and females experience the app, such as women having more granular controls over who can see their photos, and being able to view more profiles per day before being capped (this is on account of there currently being more male users, say the founders).
“It’s transparent to both sides,” says Younas of the wali/guardian option. “So both parties in that conversation know that there’s a third party involved. And for us these are optional features we give to our users — depending on where they’re at, we don’t necessarily want to push a religious angle on people, but what we want to do is give them the option. So if you’re very religiously inclined you can pick these options.”
“For us being accessible to everyone is really the key to owning this market,” he adds. “There’s 1.8 billion Muslims across the world, and they’re very diverse — in culture, in language, in their outlooks, in particular religious etiquette, so what we’re trying to do is navigate all of that in a very — I wouldn’t necessarily say neutral way — but in a very accessible way to everybody… And so far it’s been working.”
The founders say they are intentionally making an effort to discourage the transactional dynamic that can creep into dating apps like Tinder — so, for instance, there are limits on the number of profiles a user can swipe through in a 12 hour period (although users can also pay to remove the cap); and people can also go back and revisit profiles they previously passed on, or rematch with people they previously unmatched if they change their mind later.
“We’ve actually had many examples of now married couples that have actually gone back and changed their minds,” says Brodie. “Unlike say on Tinder you can actually rematch someone. So you can unmatch if it didn’t work out and then in case six months later, something’s changed… you can rematch them.”
“We had a girl message us saying thank god for the rematch feature — because I wouldn’t have got with this guy if you didn’t have it,” adds Younas. “So we know this stuff works.”
Younas boostrapped and built the initial app himself, having — as a young Muslim in London — been unimpressed with the quality of existing Muslim dating websites, which he describes as “ugly and horrible”, and having a “terrible reputation”.
Brodie came on board later, after meeting Younas and being excited by the early traction for the MVP — and the pair relaunched Muzmatch last August.
With growing ambitions, they say they started to feel London was not the ideal base to try to scale a consumer app. Hence they applied and got onto Y Combinator’s program — and will be graduating in the 2017 summer batch of YC startups.
“Our ambitions have grown and grown and grown,” says Brodie. “We realized the opportunity we have here and we thought, in London at least, we weren’t going to get the ammo that we needed or the thoughts and the beliefs that you have in the West Coast of America… [YC] has got an incredible track record so we just thought let’s do this.”
While they’ve started with Muslims living in the West, their ambitions scale to the global Muslim market as a whole — seeing big potential to grow beyond their first focus on markets with a low density of Muslims.
Indeed, Brodie argues there’s even more need for a matchmaking app in majority Muslim countries which he says already have big but — as he sees it — ineffective and often expensive matchmaking industries. So, in other words, a high density of potential mates is still a problem for a matchmatching app to fix.
“There’s already a huge market of matchmakers [in countries like Indonesia]. But it’s incredibly ineffective,” he argues. “It’s not just a problem in the West, where there’s low density, even in a country where everyone’s a Muslim, as is the case for everyone, finding partners is very difficult.”
In terms of competition, and setting aside the older generation of matchmaking websites, Brodie says there are a “few” others trying to build dating apps for Muslim singles — a quick search on the App Store brings up Minder and Salaam-Swipe as just two examples — but claims Muzmatch is at least twice as big as “our nearest app competitor”.
“Our competitors are going about this completely the wrong way,” he argues. “They are essentially repackaging Tinder for Muslims which we know just doesn’t work and is why our competition has really bad credibility in the community.”
“The key for us is we’ve tried to go about this with an understanding of the Muslim culture and the particular quirks and sensibilities in terms of how they find a partner,” adds Younas.
“And this is why, for a lot of Muslims, Western dating apps don’t work because it doesn’t really cater to that particular need and intent. So, for us, from the beginning we’ve really thought about that, and ingrained that into our design and into our product. And we think, long term, that will set us apart.”
The founders also reckon Muzmatch might stand a better chance than typical dating apps of monetizing beyond the business of matching and dating itself — by offering related services, such as, for example, helping users find a wedding venue. Which may be important if their users are pairing up and getting married relatively quickly.
“I think we have a better chance than most to achieve monetization post-match. Because just the [short] timespan [between Muslims finding a partner and getting married] and the relationship with us is so close to the events unfolding I think, longer term, this might be an interesting space for us,” says Brodie.
“Right now the Muslim market is huge, so we’re not going to run out of customers,” adds Younas.
As they head into YC demo day, the pair are looking to raise funding but Younas says they intend to “tread carefully”, given Muzmatch is already profitable — the aim is to raise to “really accelerate things but on a more sustainable level”, he says.
They want to invest in areas such as localization and growing the size of the team (from currently just the two of them), so any funding will be going towards preparing for future growth, such as by investing in headcount and backend infrastructure.
“We have global ambitions,” says Younas. “We’re not just looking at the US, Canada and the UK. We really want to be the global player for Muslims worldwide looking for a partner.”
“Without a doubt, in ten years’ time, someone will have achieved this. We want to achieve this — and part of this raise will be making sure we have the ammo to really go for it,” adds Brodie. “We’re not just a niche dating app. This is totally different.
“This is a unique product, for 1.8 billion people… Half of the world’s population of Muslims are under thirty. In countries like Saudi Arabia, two-thirds of their population are under thirty. The growth in Muslim population across the world is phenomenal.”",2017-08-03,1523001,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/p1050607.jpg?w=738,social/,"social-software,dating",YC-backed Muzmatch definitely doesn’t want to be Tinder for Muslims,tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/yc-backed-muzmatch-definitely-doesnt-want-to-be-tinder-for-muslims/
