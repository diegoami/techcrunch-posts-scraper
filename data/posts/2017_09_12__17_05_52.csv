Ron Miller,Cloud,"One of the primary benefits of using Slack is the ability to communicate and share information across a company, but as usage scales it can sometimes lead to information overload and an inability to keep work organized. Pingpad released an update today to bring an organizational layer to Slack that could help teams keep their project information more orderly inside the communications tool.
“Most companies we work with spend 80 percent of their time in Slack, but the conversational UI is a blessing and a curse,” Pingpad CEO and co-founder Ross Mayfield told TechCrunch. “Slack is great at communication, but it doesn’t support collaboration and coordination. We help you get Slack organized,” he explained.
The update includes a new concept called Pingpad boards, which offers a Trello-like experience for organizing projects by content type such as open items, completed tasks and shared documents. Each of these items is more than a simple to-do task. They are each full-fledged documents unto themselves. Clicking any item on the board opens an editor for adding content.
While the board is separate from Slack, the work on the board is fully integrated in Slack via Pingpad Conversations.
“Today we have Pingpad Conversations that let you have a focused conversation on a task, a decision or content you are creating, which are synced across Slack or in the PIngpad Web App,” Mayfield explained.
That means if you share a note created in Slack, the Pingpad bot recognizes it as a note and allows you to see more information about it, while teeing up next actions such as providing feedback about the content or even closing the item when it’s completed. All changes get synced across Slack and Pingpad automatically.
Pingpad was first released last year as a stand-alone Wiki for use with Slack. You could create documents in Pingpad and share them inside Slack, but not much more. The update provides, not only the ability to create and share underlying project documents created in Pingpad, but also additional conversational structure for projects within Slack through on-going automated integration with Pingpad and the ability to collaborate with colleagues and move projects forward.
Not surprisingly, Mayfield doesn’t see this as additional set of activities, so much as a helper tool to make Slack users more productive. “What we are doing is helping things get done in the flow of the regular work where they are doing their work now,” he said.",2017-09-12,1539218,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/30298285936_0dae10d50f_k.jpg?w=738,startups/,"communication,collaboration,pingpad",Pingpad update brings organizational layer to Slack,slack,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/pingpad-update-brings-organizational-layer-to-slack/
Romain Dillet,Entertainment,"French startup Soundcharts is building a sort of App Annie for music artists. This service gives you a ton of data about what’s playing on the radio around the world, what’s popular in Spotify playlists and more. The company just raised $3.1 million  (€2.65M) from Alven Capital, as well as Kima Ventures and Global Founders Capital.
Many big music labels already work with companies to get insights about radio airplay. They pay a ton of money to Nielsen to access this data for instance.
Soundcharts wants to level the playing field and add more data. Many people don’t tune into the radio to find new music. They subscribe to popular playlists on Spotify, they follow artists on Facebook and more. If you want to stay ahead of the game, airtime is not enough, at least not anymore.
“We want to be the Bloomberg Finance of music,” founder and CEO David Weiszfeld told me. “Or like what App Annie is doing for apps.”
Soundcharts has servers around the world listening to hundreds of radios at the same time. These servers are using music recognition technology like Shazam to turn an audio signal into structured data.
This way, you can browse by country, by station, by artist or by song and see who is playing what. You can compare your artists with your competitors, you can find out what’s popular and more. It’s also a good tool for festival programmers.
Soundcharts is also using Spotify’s API to index all public playlists and track changes. This way, when a Chvrches song is added to an official Spotify playlist, you can see it in Soundcharts. And if you’re looking for common trends, the service also tracks playlist growth. You’ll be the first to know if dubstep is making a comeback.
Finally, Soundcharts tracks Facebook likes, gives you a breakdown by country and tells you about growth. There are many social media analytics services out there, but it’s a nice way to make Soundcharts a one stop shop. Everybody can access all data, so it’s not limited to your own artists.
So far, 250 companies have signed up, including employees working for Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music, as well as independent labels, publishers and management companies. Those companies pay a recurring subscription to access Soundcharts.",2017-09-12,1539262,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/shutterstock_178918328.jpg?w=738,startups/,france-newsletter,Soundcharts is an analytics tools for music artists and labels,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/soundcharts-is-an-analytics-tools-for-music-artists-and-labels/
Ron Miller,Cloud,"Software quality-assurance testing has sometimes taken a backseat in today’s rush-rush agile development environment. Into the breach has stepped on-demand testing startups like Test IO, giving developers easy access to a stable of qualified QA testers.
The company announced a new plug-in today that embeds the Test IO service directly into the Atlassian Jira development workflow tool. The tool is available in the Atlassian Marketplace.
Once installed, developers simply click the Test IO button directly in the Jira interface to select their testing parameters and start the workflow. The service then locates available testers who have the expertise and equipment the developer requires, Test IO CEO Philip Soffer explained.
Soffer says they have a team of 30,000 vetted software testers, who get cross-checked by human supervisors until they reach a consistent testing level. Each person is ranked by their quality, availability and other factors. When a programmer asks for someone with a specific skill and equipment, they get routed to the most qualified person currently available online who matches the requirements. If it requires more than one skill, the testing request could get routed to multiple testers simultaneously. The idea is to get the QA completed as quickly and accurately as possible under real-world testing conditions.
Upon completion of the review, a report with screenshots and screen cam movies showing problems is sent back immediately to the programmer with a list of problems. Developers can communicate directly with testers in the interface if they have questions about the review.
 
Given that 70 percent of Test IO customers are using Jira, it made sense for the company to make it as simple as possible to access the service. Without the Jira plug-in, developers would need to open their browser, go to the Test IO website, sign in, pick their testing parameters and upload the material to test. Much of that is taken care of with the embedded tool, and programmers never have to leave Jira to request testing or review the results.
Test IO was founded in 2011 in Berlin, and still has an office there, but it’s headquartered in San Jose now. The startup has been almost doubling revenue every year, according to Soffer, and received $5 million funding in 2015.",2017-09-12,1538993,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-697538583.jpg?w=738,startups/,"jira,atlassian,test-io",Programmers can now access Test IO code QA service in Jira development tool,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/test-io-is-now-integrated-directly-in-jira-for-on-demand-qa-testing/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Marketplace banking — the idea that your bank will provide you with access to various third-party money-related apps and services within its own app — has long been championed by fintech startups, whilst upcoming Open Banking/PSD2 legislation in the U.K. and EU, respectively, will make third-party app integration an inevitable reality. That’s seeing a number of challenger banks skating to where the puck is going, including London-based Starling Bank, which today is launching the Starling Marketplace.
Billed by the digital-only challenger bank as a new concept in banking, the Starling Marketplace puts products from other fintech providers (and in the future “lifestyle products,” because nearly every business is going to be tempted to jump onboard the Open Banking train) within “an easily browsed ecosystem” accessible within the Starling app.
Partnering companies integrate with Starling Bank via the challenger bank’s Open Banking-compliant APIs, although, as I’ll explain below, are integrating more deeply than simply making use of those APIs, which any third-party developer, once vetted, can potentially do.
The first fintech company to be added to the Starling Marketplace, and an example of the deepest kind of integration we are likely to see, is Flux, the itemised receipt and rewards startup based in London. Founded by Tom Reay, Matty Cusden-Ross, and Veronique Barbosa, all former early employees at Revolut, the company has built a software platform that bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app.
The Starling integration sees Flux send real-time itemised receipts to the Starling app when a customer pays with their Starling card at any of Flux’s retail partners, which so far includes all 111 EAT stores in the U.K. and Bel-Air. As early as next week, Flux will also enable Starling users to get automated loyalty points with cash-back for Flux-supported purchases, without the need for paper coupons. Starling Bank users will need to activate Flux from the Marketplace section of the Starling app to instantly link their card.
“This is our first native integration, where you can switch on Flux from in app, and our first full bank partnership,” Flux’s Cusden-Ross tells TechCrunch. “Starling customers should switch on Flux because we’ll help them finally rid their wallets of paper receipts and paper loyalty cards without asking them to download or setup anything extra. We also think Starling customers are particularly interested in tracking their financial life in real-time and would agree it’s insane that today the only way to keep track of exactly what we buy is via little bits of paper”.
The framing of Starling’s Flux integration as a “first full bank partnership” refers to the fact that Flux originally launched with rival challenger bank Monzo, but only in a very limited pilot that restricts the number of users that can be activated as Monzo readies its own API and marketplace banking offer.
“The users we do have have been really positive on the experience and have been driving our word of mouth sign-ups to sky-rocket, they’re all patiently on a waitlist and we’re working with Monzo to understand timelines for next steps. The on-boarding experience for Monzo is also a pilot version where the user is currently on-boarding through our website and not natively in Monzo,” explains Cusden-Ross.
In a call with Megan Caywood, Chief Platform Officer at Starling Bank, she explained that the Flux partnership, when/if Starling users choose to activate the functionality, enables a greater detail of spending data to be displayed within the Starling app for purchases made at merchants that support Flux. By default, Starling users can see the retailer’s name, amount spent, date and location (complete with a map), but Flux goes further by displaying the item bought, VAT and any available loyalty stamps.
Zooming out a bit further, Caywood says that Starling third-party integrations fall into three categories. Flux and the bank’s upcoming partnership with TransferWise are examples of the deepest type of Starling app integration but isn’t typical.
Instead, whilst they’ll be discoverable and can be authorised via something akin to an app store within the Starling app, most Marketplace apps will only send back and display a limited amount of data in the form of a dashboard or ‘widget’ (my words, not Caywood’s). If I understand correctly, in certain instances this trade-off reduces the regulatory burden on Starling and, crucially, is a good compromise to stop the Starling app from becoming bloated.
A third category of integration are apps that simply make use of Starling’s API. Right now, these include Tail, the local offers startup I recently covered, or roundups app Moneybox, which use the API to authenticate, access and build on top of various levels of your Starling bank account data and functionality, with your permission, of course.
“TransferWise will be one end of the spectrum, being deeply integrated, whereas Moneybox is at the other end of the spectrum where they just integrate our API but don’t appear in Starling,” Caywood tells me. “The Marketplace portion of the app is a hybrid – where an app has integrated our API and we have integrated theirs, so users can find them and connect to them via the Starling app, and have a dashboard in Starling that gives an overview”.
Meanwhile, I’m hearing that Flux has closed $1.5 million in seed funding led by PROfounders. I also understand that Anthemis, which has invested in other fintech companies such as Currency Cloud and Azimo, participated in the round.",2017-09-12,1538647,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/flux-receipt-in-starling.png?w=738,startups/,"starling-bank,flux","Starling Bank launches Marketplace, integrates with itemised receipt and rewards startup Flux",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/
Anthony Ha,Mobile,"EEVO‘s goal, in the words of co-founder and CEO Alejandro Dinsmore, is “democratizing the creation and delivery of immersive experiences.”
In other words, the Brooklyn startup aims to help publishers and other content creators build virtual reality experiences for smartphones without making a big investment. In fact, to use EEVO’s “Composer,” they only need 360-degree video and other media assets — no programming required.
EEVO first raised $1 million in angel funding in 2015. Since then, it participated in Techstars NYC and recently closed another $1.3 million in funding from Eagle Advisors, FundersClub, 37 Angels and others.
It also provided the technology behind the new Taster smartphone app from the BBC, which offers virtual reality experiences tied to BBC shows like Planet Earth II.
“The technology EEVO supply for our BBC Taster VR app for iPhone and Android makes creating interactive 360 video a lot easier than it has been before,” said BBC Senior Product Manager David Johnston in a statement. “The Composer window is simple enough that a content producer can use it but has enough complexity that we can try exciting new formats for the medium.”
Dinsmore said that publishers like the BBC are less focused on attracting a huge audience for their VR initiatives, and more on seeing how people respond as they experiment. And when that’s the goal, it makes less sense to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single project — instead, publishers need to find tools that allow them to create VR content quickly and consistently.
“One of the interesting shifts that we see in the ecosystem is the alignment between expectations and reality is much closer,” Dinsmore said.  “People are looking to build an internal capability around creating compelling experiences in VR and AR, rather than trying to get 1 million downloads of a VR app.”",2017-09-11,1539047,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/taster-vr.jpg?w=738,startups/,eevo,"EEVO, a startup powering VR apps for the BBC and others, raises $1.3M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/eevo-a-startup-powering-vr-apps-for-the-bbc-and-others-raises-1-3m/
Megan Rose Dickey,Startups,"Darkstore, the on-demand fulfillment startup, recently partnered with T-Force Final Mile to expand to 33 additional markets across the nation. This brings Darkstore’s total list of markets to 40, which includes San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Reno and Austin.
T-Force Final Mile is a last-mile delivery company that delivers items for IKEA, Office Depot and Amazon. Thanks to the partnership, Darkstore will be able to use T-Force’s 40 warehouses across the country as fulfillment centers.
In order to expand its customer base, Darkstore has also launched a hosted shopping cart, which makes it easy for e-commerce brands to offer on-demand delivery to its customers with just a single line of code.
Darkstore’s partnership with T-Force and the launch of its hosted shopping cart is part of Darkstore’s goal to become an “invisible retailer,” Darkstore founder Lee Hnetinka told me last week.
Darkstore works by exploiting excess capacity in storage facilities, malls and bodegas and enables them to be fulfillment centers with just a smartphone. The idea is that brands without local inventory can store it in a Darkstore and then ship out same-day. Darkstore doesn’t charge brands anything to store inventory, but charges 3 percent per item that leaves Darkstore, with a minimum of $2 and a maximum of $20.
When it comes to actual deliveries, Darkstore partners with companies like AxleHire and UberRUSH in San Francisco. In other markets, Darkstore uses services like Deliv and other local courier companies the brand wants to use.
Darkstore’s roster of customers includes mattress startup Tuft & Needle, premium headphones maker Master & Dynamic, clothing brand Wildfang and sofa startup Burrow.
Darkstore first launched last May. Since then, Darkstore has gone on to raise more than $1.5 million in funding. In April, following a $1.4 million round of funding from PivotNorth, Darkstore’s goal was to hit $110 million worth of products fulfilled by the end of this year. Darkstore hit that metric “faster than we anticipated,” Hnetinka said.
On average, Darkstore makes $16.50 per order, with an average order value of $550.22. In the last year, Darkstore has seen 25 percent month over month growth of revenue and orders.",2017-09-11,1538876,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/darkstore-lee-march-2017.png?w=738,startups/,darkstore,Darkstore wants to be the ‘invisible retailer’,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/darkstore-wants-to-be-the-invisible-retailer/
Alex Wilhelm,Europe,"

Looking at the number of exits produced and the total dollar volume those liquidity events commanded, the European startup scene has shown growth over the past year.
That fact comes from the Startups M&A 2017 Report — made in partnership with Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge. The report details the growth and maturation of the global startup scene, with a particular focus on the European continent and its most recent exit results.
This is the second time Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge have worked together to dive into the world of European startups. Last year the data, as noted on TechCrunch at the time, indicated that in the last half decade “U.S. companies have purchased about four times as many startups as European acquirers.”
So how much has changed since the last report?
The number of global startup exits from 2011 to 2017 has shown rapid growth, especially since 2014, a year that could be fairly tagged as one of the peaks in the unicorn cycle. According to the report, the 12-month period ending July, 2017 saw 4,217 startup exits, up from 2,976 in the preceding period.
However, that growth was not mirrored in the value of those exits. Of course, we are dealing with partial exit numbers, as many liquidity events are never price-disclosed. Regardless of that caveat, the following chart was eye-catching:

(Date range: July 2010 to June 2017. From the document: “Annual data refers to the period July (previous)-June (listed).”)
Even though total deal volume increased, there are three possibilities that spring to mind concerning the deceleration in exit dollar worth of those startups:
Regardless, the 2017 period as listed above set new records. This implies, with caveats, that the environment is still quite good for startups looking to tap out, trade in or join up.
Writing from Silicon Valley, it’s easy to forget that other parts of California exist. But in addition to the rest of California, it turns out whole other continents feature startup activity.
For instance, it isn’t hard to find enthusiasm about Latin America. And we can even find a little bit too much exuberance in certain sectors of the Chinese startup world. Now let’s narrow the sight on Europe, as the report has several data points concerning the continent that are worth our time.
First, cutting down from the above chart here are the exit numbers, broken down by geographic region:

In the listed 2016 period, European exits accounted for just 42.5 percent of the U.S. total. In the 2017 period, that number had risen to 52.6 percent. Of course, the raw number of U.S. exits grew dramatically over the same period. So what’s the implication? In short, the European scene, despite growth in the U.S. market, managed to grab more relative exit share.
That’s pretty bullish. Now here are the same charts tracking known exit value:

Running the same numbers, here’s what we can say: In the 2016 period, European startup exits were worth just 30.6 percent of their U.S. counterparts. In the 2017-period, that number grew to 50.9 percent.
However, as the value of U.S. startup exits fell, we could be seeing the specter of undisclosed exit values coming to roost. How likely it is that the aggregate (know and unknown) dollar value was down in the U.S. compared to the year before is up to you to determine.
Regardless, the value of European startup exits went up as its deal volume rose.
Notable in the report is cross-border startup M&A between the U.S. and Europe. Given the strong trade ties between the two areas, it’s perhaps not surprising that there is quite a lot of cross-Atlantic startup deal making.
Here are three key data points:
Summing the three, both the U.S. and Europe largely conduct M&A deals inside their own borders, which isn’t shocking. Geographical proximity counts for a lot, even in our digital age, given the wildly varying local laws concerning IP, taxes and more. But that fact doesn’t stop the continents from buying from each other. In fact, of the companies that European startups buy, a quarter were from the U.S. They were purchased at high cost, it seems, as evinced by the 58 percent number. And on the other end of the ledger, U.S.-based companies were responsible for more than a third of European startup acquisitions.
That all points to a robust cross-Atlantic startup M&A market. What will become of it when a nearly inevitable correction occurs remains to be seen. For now, times are good.",2017-09-11,1538947,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/530833852.jpg?w=738,startups/,"mergers-and-acquisitions,exits","As global startup exits grow, Europe sees its profile rise",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/as-global-startup-exits-grow-europe-sees-its-profile-rise/
Katie Roof,Automotive,"Autonomous vehicle startup Zoox is in talks with Japanese investment firm SoftBank to raise more funding. We’ve confirmed the news, which was first reported by Axios. 
We’re hearing the discussions are in the early stages and nothing has been finalized, but that SoftBank has been interested in Zoox for a while. The startup is also talking to other unnamed potential investors.
Zoox presently has a valuation above $1.5 billion and previously raised capital from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Lux Capital and others. Axios is reporting that the SoftBank conversations have been in the $3 billion to $4 billion valuation range.
Building vehicles is a capital-intensive business, so it’s no surprise that Zoox would seek more funding. And SoftBank’s Vision Fund has about $100 billion to invest, so the team is looking for opportunities to write big checks.
Zoox has been quietly building self-driving cars, sharing little detail about its plans. We’re hearing that the group has explored creating an Uber-like on-demand service.
The race to build self-driving cars has been heating up. Uber and Alphabet’s Waymo are amongst the many companies that have been building prototypes.
Zoox was founded in 2014 by Jesse Levinson, who came from Stanford’s self-driving car group, and Tim Kentley-Klay, an entrepreneur from Australia. The Menlo Park-based startup has been hiring employees from companies like Tesla, Alphabet and Apple.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Well, this is quite a coup. Entrepreneur First (EF), the London-headquartered company builder that invests in individuals “pre-team, pre-idea” to help create new technology startups, has raised $12.4 million in new funding led by Silicon Valley’s Greylock Partners.
The investment also sees Greylock partner and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman join the board. In a call, Hoffman described EF as an incubation model that “contradicts common wisdom,” and exactly the sort of idea he seeks to back.
Other investors joining the round include Mosaic Ventures (I understand Mosaic’s Toby Coppel first introduced Hoffman to EF), Founders Fund, Lakestar Capital and Deep Mind founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman.
Notable is that a number of EF alumni are also investing. They are Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang of Magic Pony Technology — the AI startup sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and the company builder’s only financially significant exit to date — and Bryan Baum, who co-founded Represent, which was sold for a reported $100 million but went through the program before EF insisted on taking a stake in the companies it helps create.
It should also be noted that the new funding round is for operational costs and to further scale the EF program. In other words, it is entirely separate from the company builder’s investment fund from which it directly invests in the founders and startups it helps create. Therefore, this is more akin to EF as a startup in its own right raising funding.
Founded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, EF bills itself as a “talent first” investor that targets the best technical and domain talent in Europe and Singapore — both recent graduates and also people already working at tech companies — and invites them to apply to its six-month program where they find co-founders and in turn found startups.
The EF program includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider U.K. and Singapore startup scene. There’s also a separate follow-on fund to co-invest in alumni companies at the seed and Series A stage.
The idea is to help talented individuals become entrepreneurs, and companies be founded, that otherwise might not. To date, EF says it has helped more than 500 individuals on its program, who have built more than 100 companies with a total (mostly on paper) valuation exceeding $1 billion.
“Even though I don’t like to invest outside of Silicon Valley, the ability to create a portfolio of great entrepreneurship and great companies is something I treat as a personal mission,” Hoffman tells me, noting that Bentinck and Clifford have created a “great model for creating new, deep tech companies on an incubation basis.”
“I think where it’s helpful is when you have depth of tech talent, creativity, an interest in creating companies but an as yet only partially developed entrepreneurial culture,” he says when asked why a model like EF is needed outside Silicon Valley. (Separately, Clifford tells me EF has no plans to expand to the U.S.)
I recount how in EF’s early days — albeit before it was anything like proven — a number of VCs I spoke to had doubts the company builder’s “pre-team, pre-idea” model could work. Hoffman sounds unsurprised.
“The number of incubators and accelerators that have failed is huge,” he says, “so what happens is that most VCs tend to be ‘look, the real entrepreneurs are just willing to go and do it themselves,’ and I would say that is common sense wisdom. Common sense wisdom has a breadth of truth to it, [but] I like to look at where the common sense wisdom has a limitation and where there is a big opportunity.”
Hoffman says he can easily see “a universe in which there’s 20 or 30 or 40 cities, maybe even 50, where Entrepreneur First is integral to creating a set of interesting tech companies in those areas.” “You can reach scale if you get the formula right,” he argues, pointing to how Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator has grown in the last decade.
So why hasn’t anyone cloned EF’s model verbatim? Clifford says it’s partly network effects — a program like EF becomes more valuable the more quality founders and companies it adds — and whilst Reid doesn’t dispute this, the answer may be even simpler.
“The reason why they haven’t been copied yet is that people don’t have a full recognition of the really interesting thing that Entrepreneur First is doing,” he says. “And of course they try to keep some of the secret sauce under the covers, too.”
Before I wrap up our call, I turn the subject to the thorny issue of Brexit. Given that a large part of EF’s current program takes place in London but attracts applicants from all over Europe, was the U.K.’s decision to vote to leave the EU a consideration before Greylock decided to invest?
“I definitely thought about it,” says Hoffman. “The impact will I think be relatively harsh over the next five or 10 years, starting with the fact that I think people are under the illusion that there is an easy divorce from the EU.”
With that said — and factoring in that we don’t yet know what a post-Brexit world will look like — he reckons there’s still “easily enough headroom” in the U.K. to create world transforming companies.",2017-09-11,1538448,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screen-shot-2017-03-07-at-14-19-34.png?w=738,startups/,"greylock-partners,entrepreneur-first","Company builder Entrepreneur First raises $12.4M led by Greylock, Reid Hoffman joins board",reid-hoffman,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/ef-greylock/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"Data Artisans, the business arm of open source tool, Apache Flink, announced an early-access release of the commercial version of their platform today that includes a new tool for managing streaming applications.
Kostas Tzoumas, CEO at Data Artisans, says managing applications on a real-time streaming product presents some serious challenges for customers, and the new Application Manager is designed to solve this.
While their larger Flink users like Netflix, Alibaba or ING have the resources and skill to build such a tool to manage and monitor high-volume streaming activity themselves, the average enterprise doesn’t have that luxury, Tzoumas said.
These customers often build applications that have to interact with a number of external systems, all while trying to process high volumes of data in near real time. The company created the management piece to reduce the complexity associated with this process, Tzoumas explained.
The new tool provides a central management console for all of the streaming activity running through Flink including the ability to view streaming data sources, developer workflows, service deployment architecture and logging and metrics tools.
Beyond managing all of the underlying services that interact with the Apache Flink streaming applications, it also allows developers to manage the applications development process, then launch their applications using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes.
What’s more, it keeps an audit trail of all user actions related to the Apache Flink stream should a team need to retrace its steps after deployment.
The company founders, Tzoumas and CTO Stephen Ewen, built Apache Flink while still in college, then went onto found Data Artisans in 2014 as the commercial arm of the company. They began with a standard open source business model, helping customers support Apache Flink and also acting as consultants to help companies build and launch their own Apache Flink streaming applications. But as they worked with customers, they saw the missing management tool as another commercial opportunity.
The company is based in Berlin and has raised nearly $7 million. Users download Apache Flink 10,000 times a month.

Bankin also competes with another app that I covered just a couple of days ago, Linxo. Both of them want to become the definite financial hub to get an overview on all your accounts, move money around and more. They all dream about becoming the ultimate banking app to rule them all.
And Bankin has already started morphing beyond a simple way to check all your accounts. You can already transfer money between multiple accounts without ever leaving the app. While only a handful of banks currently support this feature, I’m sure the company is working hard on adding more banks.
Starting today, Bankin users will also get a notification in the  notification tab (“Coach”) about tips to save money. If you tap on it, it gives you tips as well as a button to get advice. It then tells you to open an account with Yomoni to save money.
Yomoni is a robo-advisor startup. It manages a portfolio of stocks and bounds for you over multiple years. You can open a Yomoni account straight from the Bankin app. Bankin is already thinking about letting you transfer money to your Yomoni account directly from the Bankin app.
Yomoni is also paying Bankin as the financial hub is referring new users. There is an initial signup referral fee as well as some recurring revenue. This is an interesting integration and I hope there will be more like this in the future.",2017-09-11,1538695,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/shutterstock_284780360.jpg?w=738,startups/,"france-newsletter,yomoni",Bankin lets you save money on Yomoni,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/bankin-lets-you-save-money-on-yomoni/
Katie Roof,Automotive,"Dara Khosrowshahi, the recently named CEO of Uber, is leaving the New York Times Company’s board of directors.
According to a government filing, Khosrowshahi notified the NYT board on Thursday that he would be resigning from the role because of his new responsibilities at Uber. The former Expedia CEO had been on the board since 2015.
“Mr. Khosrowshahi’s decision to resign as a director was not due to any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices,” said the filing. Khosrowshahi had served on the audit committee as well as the technology and innovation committee.
He wasn’t the only tech vet on the board. Brian McAndrews, former CEO of Pandora, and Rebecca Van Dyck, CMO of Facebook’s Oculus, both have seats. 
The New York Times was recently criticized for not initially disclosing that Khosrowshahi was on its board when it wrote about him becoming the new Uber CEO. The media publication said it regretted the error, but that Khosrowshahi’s board seat had no impact on its Uber coverage.
The company’s stock is up 53% in the past year.

Connie Loizos,Real Estate,"Tech writers are invited to a lot of demo days, as you might imagine. Sometimes, these presentations are very long, with many startup teams taking the stage to pitch to investors and the media. Sometimes, they’re shorter, featuring a more concentrated group of founders. But always, the pitches are concise. In fact, most incubators or accelerators take their cue from one of the original incubators, Y Combinator, which gives each of its startups less than three minutes to dazzle the crowd.
As a result, what makes it into TechCrunch (and other outlets) on the heels of these demonstrations are very much first impressions of companies —  vague outlines of what’s interesting about them. Perhaps naturally, too, these first impressions are often appropriated by the companies themselves and turned into endorsements to gain traction with early customers.
Such is the case with Vacayo, a startup that recently passed through the 500 Startups accelerator program and which last month presented to a crowd at the Computer History Museum in San Jose, Ca., alongside 28 other startups.
On the heels of the event, we included Vacayo in our coverage of the event, explaining its proposal to become a kind of property manager to homeowners who have extra space (or extra homes) on their hands, property that the startup says it can furnish and find tenants to fill.
Vacayo has since used that coverage, including linking to it on Facebook, to solicit customers. The problem, as reported in a recent CNBC story, is that Vacayo is being highly deceptive in how it’s landing some those listings. For example, Vacayo founders Isabel Berney and Truth Oladapo rented the Miami Beach home of Bay Area entrepreneur and investor Drew Grewal, then listed the home on Airbnb without his permission.
Because of strict regulations around short-term rentals in Miami, Grewal was subsequently fined tens of thousands of dollars. After evicting the pair, Grewal tells CNBC he saw some of his furniture featured in two other Miami Beach Airbnb listings. Oladapo told CNBC that Grewal asked him to take the furniture.
Another Miami Beach property owner, Rula Giosmas, told CNBC she similarly had Airbnb-related problems at two of her four properties. She said in one case, she’d been led to believe she was renting the property to a couple with a child from New York. The tenants, she discovered, were Oladapo and Berney. Giosmas now plans to sell the property, which she says was turned into a “flop house,” and which has also attracted fines to the tune of $20,000.
Neither Isabel nor Truth Oladapo responded to requests for more information from TechCrunch earlier this week. Asked about their startup, 500 Startups declined to comment.
Maybe in an age where founders are encouraged to stretch the truth, to fake it till they make it, and to be resourceful above all else, Oladapo and Berney rationlized their approach to securing properties as unremarkable. Maybe they reasoned that as long as they were building up a client base, it wasn’t so wrong, despite the painful financial consequences their actions created for the property owners.
We disagree. In fact, we’re writing this post now because we don’t want potential customers to see our coverage in Vacayo’s marketing materials and interpret it as a kind of seal of approval. It is not. We do not know the company. We in no way sanction its reported approach. In fact, we found CNBC’s report fairly disturbing.
The truth is that we can’t really know any team that presents at a demo day. We presume that readers understand the point of these pieces: that we’re trying to bring you with us to presentations you might otherwise miss.
We continue to think these wrap-ups are useful, too. “It’s difficult to validate the claims a startup makes in a brief two or three minute pitch,” says TechCrunch writer John Mannes, the colleague who wrote about Vacayo. But “as long as we can keep everyone on the same page that we’re evaluating the pitches of mostly pre-seed startups, there’s still value in highlighting standouts.”
In the meantime, for anyone who might construe our cursory interest in a team or a technology at one of these events as anything more than that, we apologize for the confusion.",2017-09-10,1538592,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-145085300.jpg?w=738,startups/,demo-day,The downside of writing up demo days,500-startups,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/the-downside-of-writing-up-demo-days/
Romain Dillet,Europe,"French startup Linxo just raised $24 million (€20 million) from three financial institutions — Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa and MAIF. The company is building a sort of Mint for the French market.
Banking apps suck in France. Most of them are just a wrapper around a mobile website. It takes them years to adopt new features, such as fingerprint readers, widgets and more.
And many people have more than one bank account. It becomes quite tedious to check your balance and transactions on all your accounts as you have to deal with multiple shitty apps.
Linxo is trying to solve that by building an above average app and service that connects to all your bank accounts. The startup supports dozens of French banks. At first, you need to give Linxo your bank account login information. The company’s servers will then periodically sync past transactions.
This way, you get a good overview of all your bank accounts in one app. You can see past transactions and charts about money you’re spending. It’s a good way to get insights about your financial situation.
But the company plans to go one step further and build a full-fledged financial hub. Its competitor Bankin has already introduced a way to transfer money between accounts in different banks. This feature is currently limited to a handful of banks.
I’m sure Linxo has something similar in mind, as well as ways to save money, get a credit line and buy insurance products. The company has been working on Linxo Connect, a way to sign up to new financial services without leaving the app, using APIs.
With today’s funding round, the startup plans to expand to other European countries. Linxo is also working with French banks to help them with their apps and websites. This could be a lucrative market as well.",2017-09-09,1538050,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/455316308.jpg?w=738,startups/,france-newsletter,Linxo raises $24 million for its app that brings bank accounts together,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/linxo-raises-24-million-for-its-app-that-brings-bank-accounts-together/
Francisco Coronel,Startups,"

When a company expands to Latin America, it requires a great deal of effort to adapt the language, operations and marketing strategies in order to find acceptance in the local market. In Spanish, the process of adapting a product or service to the local market is called “tropicalización,” or tropicalization.
Because tropicalization is often a significant undertaking, there are countless business models in the United States and other English-speaking markets that have not yet been fully implemented in Latin America, leaving real opportunities for startups in the region. In fact, up until now, a majority of the most successful startups coming out of Latin America have fallen under the “copycat” business model. In other words, local entrepreneurs have been the ones replicating successful business models crafted by U.S. startups and launching them locally. A few examples include MercadoLibre — the “eBay,” OLX — the “Craigslist” and Despegar — the “Expedia.”
The “copycat” business model has some favorable attributes. For one, startups can easily explain their concept to local investors using the well-known “Uber for X” phrasing, allowing investors to quickly identify the problem and understand how this could be a notable solution. This tends to make securing investments in a traditionally risk-adverse region a whole lot easier.
On the other hand, there’s been a rise in truly disruptive ideas coming out of Latin America, as well. Before going into which business model is more advantageous in the region, it is also important to point out the difference between “innovation” and “disruption.”
Certainly, “copycat” startups can be innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. After all, implementing an existing business model for a local market does require creativity and a serious commitment, but true disruption uproots everything consumers currently understand, how they behave and how they do business.
According to Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen, “disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.”
It’s worth exploring which model has been more effective in Latin America and in which way will startups continue to progress. Will they continue reshaping known business models for the Latin American market? Or, are we witnessing a steady influx of ideas that are entirely brand new? To answer that question, it’s important to first explore some of the startups born from each approach, and what the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are for entrepreneurs in Latin America.
The risk-averse nature of investors in Latin America has a lot to do with why so many VCs have felt much more confident investing in ideas that mimic successful companies in the U.S. or Europe. However, as the saying goes, an idea alone is not always the key to success; what matters is execution.
Replicating an existing business model can be extremely challenging in a complex region like Latin America. In some cases, startups find adapting relatively easy. However, most of the time it can be a tough path. Nicolas Szekasy, an investor and board member of Restorando, Latin America’s “OpenTable,” argues that most copycats in the region are simply variations using the same technology. He goes on to say, “that if the companies initially appear to be copycats of their U.S. counterparts, they often adapt and adjust along the way to successfully serve the local market, and ultimately end up with very different business models.”

The true definition of a “copycat” is still very much open to interpretation. However, what really matters is that this approach does have its advantages, and, many times, Latin American startups are implementing existing ideas in a better way — or creating more value than how the original model was designed.
Take Brazil’s Dafiti, for example. Now part of Berlin-based Rocket Internet, which is famous for applying proven ideas in other countries in emerging markets, Dafiti based its original business model off of U.S.-based Zappos and tailored the business model to fit the Latin American market. In doing so, it became quite successful in the region and joined Rocket Internet’s global fashion group, which is now valued at $1.1 billion.
Brazilian technology-powered freight broker CargoX also found considerable success with its “Uber for trucking” business model. Brazil reportedly has an excess of between 300,000 and 350,000 vehicles, with trucks running empty 40 percent of the time. The goal of CargoX is to reduce the number of empty trucks on the highway, increase revenue for truckers and reduce costs for freight owners.
Between its launch in 2013 and last year, CargoX added 100,000 members, equivalent to 10 percent of self-employed truck drivers in Brazil. In a single day, the company once registered 5,000 downloads, according to the company’s CEO, Argentine Federico Vega. Fast-forward to today, and CargoX has raised an additional $10 million in Series B funding from Goldman Sachs, established a network of more than 150,000 trucks and has laid the foundation for a sustainable transportation company with great potential for expansion throughout the rest of the region.
A few other examples of the applied business model, or “copycat” successes in the region include:
In today’s digital age, ideas can travel much faster than companies can. Nonetheless, what matters most is the execution of those ideas. In many of the above cases, the “copycat” approach has its definite advantages. These Latin American entrepreneurs are well aware that with the right strategies in place, they can adapt profitable business models from the U.S. and Europe to the local market and grow them quickly — with expansion and exit strategies already in place.
Even though there are plenty of inspiring “copycat” startups in Latin America upheld by innovative founders, high valuations and millions of users, this way of thinking is not without its criticisms.
During the last decade, many involved in the Latin American ecosystem have pointed out that simply copying what U.S. and European startups are doing is no longer a sustainable model. In Latin America, the majority of entrepreneurs and investors have become far too comfortable with this strategy, always looking for easy wins. However, if the region is going to partake in global innovation, then entrepreneurs and investors must start focusing more on real disruption.
The good news is that there are fewer and fewer copycats, as Latin America’s entrepreneurs are becoming much more aware that they must compete globally. Startups like Satellogic are evidence of this shift in thinking. The company is on a mission to develop commercial-grade satellites at an extremely low cost, for less than $100,000. The founder and CEO, Argentine Emiliano Kargieman, is a hacker at heart, with years of experience in the technology landscape.
Satellogic is planning to launch a constellation of nanosatellites into orbit that will generate real-time images from all over the planet  —  an incredibly valuable asset for hundreds of industries. No company has attempted this before, and Satellogic’s approach has the potential to truly disrupt the satellite data market.

There are plenty of other disruptors emerging in Latin America. In fact, these companies can already be counted by the thousands and are spreading beyond the internet into new sectors like agtech, clean energy, biotechnology, digital medicine, renewable energy, software security, IoT and AI. “Latin America is witnessing the emergence and growth of a new species of companies that is transforming our business landscape,” a new report on Tecnolatinas (technology-based private companies born in the region) states. “And most of these Tecnolatinas are entrepreneur-driven, digital ventures with an international footprint.”
Semtive, founded by a team of Argentines, is producing turbines designed for low wind speeds — unlike traditional wind farms that rely on speeds of 30 mph or greater. With the smallest model starting at $4,600 USD, the startup hopes to become the first and most affordable small wind turbine on the market for homes and businesses.
The Latin American agricultural technology market is expected to reach $541.8 million by 2022, and BovControl is another company disrupting “business as usual” by supporting efficient farm production using data collection techniques, cloud computing and information delivery. Founded in Brazil, where there are more cows than people, BovControl is now used on thousands of farms across the world.
To draw a conclusion as to which approach is better for startups in Latin America, it strongly depends on the definition of success being used. For example, success could be based on the total funding companies have raised using each approach. In this case, one could look at the most recent Latin American Venture Capital Trend Watch Report by LAVCA, which describes the top 10 venture capital deals made in 2016. Of the 10 largest deals, the majority were made in companies whose businesses appear to mimic existing models in the U.S., such as Square, Lending Club and Postmates.
If the definition of success is an acquisition, then of the dozen or so Latin American startups listed here that have been acquired by companies abroad since 2013, three-to-four companies could be considered truly disruptive. The other nine or more used an applied business model approach and were acquired by similar services abroad as a strategic entrance into the region.
And finally, one of the more conventional ways to measure startup success is to examine valuations. Of the nine Latin American companies currently in the billion-dollar club, three are clearly using an applied business model approach and six have developed disruptive solutions.
It is possible to draw conclusions based on the data above, but for the most part, it remains to be seen which business model is producing the most startup successes in Latin America as the ecosystem is still relatively young when compared to other more mature ecosystems. Additionally, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages when applied in Latin America. The “copycat,” or applied business model approach, can be used to fulfill unmet needs in an existing category. For the most part, it also tends to be faster and cheaper. However, execution is key and speed matters, as companies who opt for this route often face a lot more competition.

The innovative, disruptor approach has its unique advantages in that companies can create their own category, and, therefore, are faced with less competition. And even though a disruptive approach tends to be more capital-intensive, it’s usually from this side that the world’s most visionary leaders are born. As someone who has invested in companies on both sides of the table, I can confidently say that Latin America is filled with incredibly innovative entrepreneurs creating real solutions to real problems in Latin America — and they are doing so by any means possible.

Connie Loizos,Startups,"If you’ve never worked for a complete jerk, consider yourself lucky. Roughly one in five people polled say they’ve experienced bullying in the workplace, according to a 2017 study commissioned by the Workplace Bullying Institute. The study — which is actually pretty fascinating — concluded that 61 percent of the time, the bully is the person to whom an employee reports directly. Bullies are also men 70 percent of the time, while 66 percent of the time it’s women who are targets of bullying.
None of this is news to Stanford Professor Bob Sutton, who co-founded both the d.school and Stanford Tech Ventures. He authored “The No Asshole Rule” a decade ago, and, relying on academic studies and thousands of email exchanges and conversations he has had with readers since, Sutton is now publishing a follow-up book next week called “The Asshole Survival Guide.”
We talked with Sutton yesterday about what it means to be an asshole, how to work alongside one and why startups likely have more than their fair share of them.
TC: You cover a lot of ground in this book, which is basically a guide to figuring out a way to survive a terrible human being based on how much power you have. Why write a second book on this particular topic?
BS: “The No Asshole Rule” was really meant to be about building relatively jerk-free cultures, but people from all corners have been approaching me ever since, saying, “I work with a jerk. What do I do?” I sort of became the Dr. Phil for people with asshole problems.
TC: Is this meant to mostly entertain? Is it anecdotal?
BS: I did want it to be entertaining and readable, but I take an evidence-based perspective. I’m an organizational researcher at Stanford, so I’ve carefully reviewed thousands of economic papers on bullying and abusive workplaces.
TC: You talk a lot about creating physical and mental distance from bullies. But I’ve interviewed one of your Stanford colleagues in the past, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who takes a very different stance. He argues that you’ve got to fight bullies or else lose to them. His thinking is that nice guys finish last.
BS: I’ve written two books with Jeff and although he loves making that argument, he’s in the minority. My personal philosophy is that if you’re a winner and an asshole, you’re still a loser as a human being. But further, if you look at Adam Grant, who’s perhaps the most respected researcher in our field, and a host of others of us, we think if you beat people badly, you may win in the short term, but your enemies lie in wait to bring you down.
TC: You hear that refrain a lot in startups I think — the founder who was wronged or underestimated and has an axe to grind so starts his or her own company. 
BS: Sure! Look at Tony Fadell [who worked for Steve Jobs and later co-founded Nest Labs, which Google acquired for $3.2 billion]. Getting even can be a motivation, absolutely.
TC: You may know more about Fadell’s relationship with Jobs than I do. Maybe I should back up and ask what you mean by asshole. Is it another word for someone who’s “political” in a work setting?
BS: The definition I use is that you’re having interactions with someone who leaves you feeling demeaned, de-energized and disrespected. It could be because they are nasty to everyone. It could be that you’re egging them on. It could also be that you’re thin-skinned. In fact, you’re right that people are often political opponents, in which case the odds that I think they are an asshole and they think I am as asshole are pretty high. But even in that situation, there are things you need to do so that your productivity and mental health don’t deteriorate.
TC: New research suggests that it’s most often someone’s boss who they deem an asshole. Do you think that’s partly because people hate hierarchies?
BS: If you look at research on who tends to be a workplace bully, the most frequent culprit is the person next up the hierarchy from us. The notion that people quit bosses instead of organizations is well-documented.
There are also studies that show when you put people in positions of power, they become more focused on their own needs than others; they become more rude. So if you’re going to pick the asshole, the most immediate culprit is someone’s immediate boss.
TC: So you get away from that person. But to Pfeffer’s point, if you opt out, isn’t it game over?
BS: If you’re going to work every day and someone is treating you with disrespect or you’re constantly exposed to bullying, it can lead to trouble with your family, mental health problems, sleeplessness. I think you’re a quitter and a winner if you get out of that situation. By Jeffrey’s logic, people would never divorce abusive spouses, either.
One thing I do emphasize is the importance of how you quit. We love the idea of the person who says, “Take this job and shove it,” but we all need our social networks. Slowly figuring out your exit options in a way that preserves those is a much better way to go about it. Unless you’re rich, like Fadell. In which case it doesn’t matter. [Laughs.]
TC: Continuing to play devil’s advocate here, people like to think organizations care about them more than they might. Do employees sometimes mistake a focus on the bottom line for assholishness?
BS: If you look at our biases as humans, we do overestimate how much people care about us or how important we are to others, so I think that is an issue. [With pro basketball, for example] it might lead you to label someone as an asshole if they traded you and you thought you were important. Either way, you need to change the situation.
TC: What if you don’t have the resources to leave it?
BS: There are a number of mind tricks that I outline in the book. One centers on temporal distance. You look for the silver lining in a situation. It’s, “Gee, that person just treated me like dirt, but when I look back on it a year from now, it won’t hurt so much.” Reframing things in such a way that they can seem funny to you helps, too.
There are also ways to get rid of the local asshole, but you’ll need a posse.
TC: Before you go, do you think bullying is any worse at startups? We’ve obviously seen a lot of headlines about bad behavior this year.
BS: If you want to talk about situations where you’re going to turn people into jerks, yes. If you put someone under a lot of time pressure, make them tired and sleep deprived, place them in a position where they feel powerful — and they felt powerless before — then potentially add physical crowding, it’s a pretty good recipe for bringing out the worst in any human being.
It’s frankly amazing how civilized many startups are despite the pressure they face.",2017-09-08,1537588,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/bob-sutton-2.jpg?w=738,startups/,stanford,A Stanford professor’s advice on surviving the a**hole at your startup,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/a-stanford-professors-advice-on-surviving-the-ahole-at-your-startup/
John Biggs,Startups,"The private data of 143 million Equifax “customers” is now available for download. Have no doubt: This means you will be hacked. This means your SIM card can be spoofed. This means someone will try to get into your email and online accounts. This means someone will try to open a credit card in your name. This crass, callow, and lazy treatment of our digital data cannot stand. Equifax – and every company that dumps data like an airplane toilet dumps chunks of frozen urine – must face a reckoning.
First, we cannot allow our most precious data to be accessible via the last four digits of our social security number. Any new company that does this should be shut down. Once I tell a customer service representative the last four digits of my SSN – I just did it a moment ago with an insurance company and it sprang open my personal data like a cheap padlock – I’ve lost all security. That CSR can use my data. Someone can overhear my weak PIN. What’s worse, I use that PIN everywhere. Entering my SSN into a random form field on some well-meaning site means I’ve essentially written the password to most of my personal data on a busy highway overpass. These places are that insecure.
We must look outside the US for leadership. Estonia, for example, has already released a number of solutions to this problem including a cryptographically secure ID card. This card connects to our computers and unlocks our data. Without it no one can access our data. An even easier solution could include government-provided 2-factor ID generator. These are cheap and portable and rugged and far more secure than any static number. Further, we must also outlaw SMS two-factor authentication. In fact, thanks to the data stolen from Equifax, that process can be easily broken by (you guessed it) telling a CSR the last four digits of our Social Security Number.
Ultimately we must hold these companies accountable. Target loses your data? Don’t shop at Target. Trump Hotels dumps your credit cards for the third time in two years? Maybe AirBnB is for you. Equifax dumps your social security number? Don’t depend on their data for your products.
We must create new, secure methods for cryptographically securing our data. We must make it so that a hacker with a fast connection and knowledge of the tar command cannot drag our data off of a secure server.
Equifax, for its part, has all but given up. Their security site – a site where you type in the last six digits of your SSN and your last name to see if you’ve been hacked – seems to be down and/or attacked by phishing scammers. This kind of technical incompetence is disgusting.
Mistakes happen. Unfortunately, they tend to matter more at the very organizations where time, ineptitude, and complacence have reduced data security to a tertiary concern, well under “deciding what’s for lunch” and “increasing shareholder value.” These old organizations – Equifax was founded in 1899 and hasn’t changed much since inception – must die, to be replaced by solutions that (and I shudder to say this) blockchain-based. I shudder because I know that the dangers to our data are far more expansive if we hand them over to the cryptoratii but, ultimately, this must be the way we go.
There is precedent for this sort of technological shift. Twenty years ago if you told a CTO that she would one day pick a homegrown operating system full of bugs and spaghetti code over Microsoft she would have laughed you out of the office. “No one gets fired for buying Microsoft,” was the old saying. Now if you recommended a Windows installation over spinning up a few Ubuntu instances on Heroku you’d be considered a madman.
In short, it’s time for those who are careless big data to die. It’s up to you, the entrepreneur, to offer true and viable alternatives. Because losing your personal data is awful the first time but when it happens again and again there has to be a better way.

Matt Burns,Gadgets,"The American Red has teamed up with the UPS Foundation and drone manufacturer CyPhy Works to bring drones to sites of natural disasters. The goal is to use drones tethered to the ground to assess damages through constant aerial observations. This is where CyPhy Works comes in.
The pilot program utilizes CyPhy Works’ Persistent Aerial Reconnaissance and Communications (PARC) platform. In this test the platform will provide constant power to a drone flying stationary at 400ft through the use of a tether. Since the drone is tied to the ground, constant power can be provided from a ground-based generator thus providing uninterrupted surveillance for days or weeks at a time. A 30X zoom camera will then be used to surveil tens of miles around the drone and would be able to assess the impact of a disaster to best direct relief efforts and later to accelerate insurance payout.
The parties involved agreed to launch a one week, onsite trial in an area heavily flooded by Hurricane Harvey. If successful, it could be used again following Hurricane Irma.

Sarah Perez,Media,"AT&T announced this morning it’s adding free HBO to all customers on its unlimited wireless plans, including both Unlimited Plus and Unlimited Choice. The carrier in April had offered free HBO only to those on Unlimited Plus – its premium tier – but today’s move brings the network to the Unlimited Choice plan as well.
Currently, AT&T’s Unlimited Choice plan offers unlimited data, talk and text for $60 per month, or 4 lines for under $40 per line.
The option will become available to both new and existing AT&T Unlimited Choice customers starting on Friday, September 15th, says AT&T.
The addition of HBO doesn’t change the pricing for either plan, however – instead, it’s being used as a lure to entice more customers to switch to AT&T and retain existing ones, while leveraging the company’s soon-to-close acquisition of Time Warner, the parent company for HBO. The deal is expected to go through, so AT&T isn’t wasting much time putting its various assets to use.
As before when it rolled out free HBO to Unlimited Plus customers, AT&T is also sweetening this new deal by offering a $25 monthly video credit for Unlimited Choice customers that can be used towards any applicable AT&T video service, including its streaming service for cord cutters, DirecTV Now, as well as DirecTV and U-Verse TV.
With the $25 credit, that means AT&T customers can basically add on over-the-top streaming TV for $10 per month, as DirecTV Now’s plans begin at $35 per month. The fine print, however, notes that the credit starts within three billing cycles, so don’t expect it right away.
Customers with an existing AT&T video service will have HBO added for no extra charge to their existing plan, while current HBO subscribers will just no longer have to pay, the announcement explains. For those who don’t subscribe to HBO through an AT&T video service, they’ll be able to access HBO through the DirecTV Now and HBO GO applications.
The new offer comes shortly after rival T-Mobile said it would begin giving away free Netflix to its unlimited data family plans, as both carriers try to find an angle to promote their unlimited plans in the wake of Verizon’s [disclosure: TechCrunch parent, by way of AOL] decision to throttle video in its own unlimited plan.",2017-09-12,1539246,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/game-of-thrones-phone.png?w=738,mobile/,"wireless,time-warner,hbo,att",AT&T expands free HBO to both its unlimited wireless plans,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/att-expands-free-hbo-to-both-its-unlimited-wireless-plans/
Natasha Lomas,Asia,"Apple is preparing to draw scores of eyes to Cupertino later today as it unboxes a clutch of new iPhones, including a new premium handset, called the iPhone X, slated to have a near bezel-less OLED display, a 3D face unlock feature and a $1,000+ price-tag, while bringing various new camera and feature tweaks — many of which have leaked in recent weeks.
Even so, the new iPhones are set to look like, well, iPhones — aka slabs of expensively shiny glass.
So what better time for rival Samsung to tease that it might finally be nearing the point of outing something rather different: A smartphone with a foldable screen — encouraging consumers who might be thinking of shelling out serious bucks for Apple’s new glass slabs to think twice.
Bloomberg reports that Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung’s mobile business, has said the company is setting its sights on 2018 to release a smartphone with a bendable display.
“As the head of the business, I can say our current goal is next year,” he told reporters. “When we can overcome some problems for sure, we will launch the product.”
He was speaking at a press event in South Korea announcing the Galaxy Note 8 phablet to domestic media. The future foldable phone is intended to sit in the same Galaxy Note portfolio line-up, according to his comments.
Samsung has been teasing the fact it’s working on a bendable device for multiple years now — showing investors a range of folding prototypes in 2013, and teasing bendy screen concepts (branded Youm) at CES that year. Though its tests date back further still, while it’s been showing off concept videos of flexible devices for a similarly long time.
But while Samsung has been happy to scatter suggestive tidbits about its folding phone plans over the years, the date for a potential commercial release has never been firmed up. Instead possible release years have been mentioned then pushed further forward in time — apparently as it encountered new manufacturing complications.
So it’s fair to say that the latest claim — that 2018 might finally be the year of the folding phone  — should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Especially as the timing of the tease coincides with the most important date in the Apple calendar: iPhone X day.
And, well, let’s face it, concept smartphones don’t have a great record of ever seeing the light of day either.
Even if you assume Samsung has made some progress on its bendable prototypes, having worked on the concept for more than five years at this point, there’s no doubt that creating a screen robust enough to be opened and closed (and prodded) as much as 150 times+ a day by touchscreen-addicted humans is a huge challenge.
And after the flaming disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, which had to be recalled after some batteries caught fire, the risk-margin for Samsung on this potential release must be very tight indeed…
No one wants a folding phone if that means screen glitches and/or a handset that feels tacky and whose dimensions hark back to the heft of late 1990s mobile devices.
(For the record, Samsung’s folding phone has been rumored to be called the Galaxy X. So Apple’s choice of premium brand name for its top tier new iPhone is probably causing more than a little irritation in South Korea.)
We’re liveblogging Apple’s launch event here, and here’s details on how to watch the keynote. So stay tuned for all the news from Cupertino.
Bloomberg also reported Samsung’s Dong-jin saying it’s working with audio device maker Harman, which it acquired last year, to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled speaker for voice commanding to play music and conduct other tasks — aka an Amazon Echo inspired Apple HomePod clone in the making.",2017-09-12,1539162,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_2729.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"smartphone,harman,iphone","Ahead of iPhone X day, Samsung teases 2018 foldable phone launch plan",samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/ahead-of-iphone-x-day-samsung-teases-2018-foldable-phone-launch-plan/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"Apple is holding a keynote today at the brand new Steve Jobs Theater on Apple Campus, and the company is expected to unveil new iPhone models, a new Apple Watch as well as a new Apple TV. At 10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris), you’ll be able to watch the event as the company is streaming it live.
You know what September means. It means that Apple is about to unveil a new iPhone. But this year is going to be different as the company should unveil not one, not two but three different models. There should be a new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as well as a mysterious iPhone X. There were many leaks already, but some details are still unclear. Also, you can count on a new Apple Watch as well as a much more powerful Apple TV. It’s going to be a packed event.
If you have the current Apple TV, you can download the Apple Events app in the App Store. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old events. Users with old Apple TVs can simply turn on their devices. Apple is pushing out the “Apple Events” channel so that you can watch the event.
And if you don’t have an Apple TV, the company also lets you live-stream the event from the Apple Events section on its website. This video feed only works in Safari and Microsoft Edge; the good news is that it works on macOS, iOS and Windows 10 – chances are you have at least one device running Safari or Edge.

Anthony Ha,Mobile,"EEVO‘s goal, in the words of co-founder and CEO Alejandro Dinsmore, is “democratizing the creation and delivery of immersive experiences.”
In other words, the Brooklyn startup aims to help publishers and other content creators build virtual reality experiences for smartphones without making a big investment. In fact, to use EEVO’s “Composer,” they only need 360-degree video and other media assets — no programming required.
EEVO first raised $1 million in angel funding in 2015. Since then, it participated in Techstars NYC and recently closed another $1.3 million in funding from Eagle Advisors, FundersClub, 37 Angels and others.
It also provided the technology behind the new Taster smartphone app from the BBC, which offers virtual reality experiences tied to BBC shows like Planet Earth II.
“The technology EEVO supply for our BBC Taster VR app for iPhone and Android makes creating interactive 360 video a lot easier than it has been before,” said BBC Senior Product Manager David Johnston in a statement. “The Composer window is simple enough that a content producer can use it but has enough complexity that we can try exciting new formats for the medium.”
Dinsmore said that publishers like the BBC are less focused on attracting a huge audience for their VR initiatives, and more on seeing how people respond as they experiment. And when that’s the goal, it makes less sense to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a single project — instead, publishers need to find tools that allow them to create VR content quickly and consistently.
“One of the interesting shifts that we see in the ecosystem is the alignment between expectations and reality is much closer,” Dinsmore said.  “People are looking to build an internal capability around creating compelling experiences in VR and AR, rather than trying to get 1 million downloads of a VR app.”",2017-09-11,1539047,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/taster-vr.jpg?w=738,mobile/,eevo,"EEVO, a startup powering VR apps for the BBC and others, raises $1.3M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/eevo-a-startup-powering-vr-apps-for-the-bbc-and-others-raises-1-3m/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Facebook doesn’t want you to burn through your mobile data plan just to keep watching its videos. That’s why it’s testing a new feature called Instant Videos that downloads and caches Facebook videos to your phone while you’re on Wi-Fi so you can watch them later on the go for free. Users will see lightning bolt icons on pre-loaded videos.
The Instant Video feature is reminiscent of Instant Articles, Facebook’s hosted content format that loads much faster than mobile websites so users don’t drop off waiting for a publisher’s articles to appear. Because videos load even slower than web pages, publishers might be keen to get involved to ensure maximum viewability for their clips.
The feature could also benefit Facebook’s new Watch tab of original video content, allowing it to cache episodes so people could watch them on a train or elsewhere that they might not have a strong connection or want to use up their data plan watching longer-form videos.
Facebook confirms to TechCrunch that the Instant Video test is available to a small percentage of Android users. A screenshot of Instant Videos was first shared by “Devesh Logendran” using a pseudonym to TNW’s director of social media Matt Navarra. Now we’ve confirmed with Facebook that the goal is to remove data costs as a barrier to watching its videos.
Previously, Facebook has tried to adapt its service for differing bandwidth and data prices by re-ranking News Feed to prioritize low file-size content while downranking videos if you’re on a slow connection, or replaying stories you’d already seen.
While Instant Articles has mostly focused on the speed and convenience of reading news on Facebook, Instant Video focuses on the cost and accessibility. That could make the feature a major boon to Facebook’s efforts in the developing world. There, mobile data prices can be quite high compared to average incomes, and spotty network connections can make watching video frustrating.
But if Facebook wants to be the social network of tomorrow, not just today, it knows it must whole-heartedly embrace video, which can deliver more vivid entertainment and interpersonal connection than text or photos. Interaction with mobile video is skyrocketing, according to a NewsWhip study shared by eMarketer showing a massive 53 percent year-over-year increase in engagement with news outlet videos on Instagram.
Video also carries lucrative advertisements that are closer to the television commercials that brands are accustomed to making. Getting people accustomed to watching organic videos can make them more receptive to watching video ads. Plus, Facebook is starting to allow video creators and publishers to insert video ad breaks into the middle of their clips, and splits the revenue, with 55 percent going to the creator. Instant Videos could potentially include these ad breaks.
By testing Instant Videos on Android, Facebook is laying the groundwork for both serving the developing world where iPhones are more rare, and more budget-conscious teens in the developed world. Combining forward-thinking accessibility initiatives with its engineering prowess and ubiquity could help Facebook excel beyond YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and other competitors that also see video as the future.",2017-09-11,1539045,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/facebook-video-world2.png?w=738,mobile/,,Facebook tests pre-loaded ‘Instant Videos’,facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-instant-video/
Evan Engstrom,Mobile,"

More than two decades ago, Qualcomm unveiled a baseband processor that enabled the earliest cell phones to connect with the cellular network. This was a big breakthrough, both for the consumers who quickly embraced the technology and for Qualcomm, which held a patent on the technology and consequently established an immense revenue stream from the growing cellular market.
But, as often happens when control over a powerful technology is vested in a single entity, Qualcomm has wielded its baseband processor patent in anticompetitive ways to protect its revenue stream. Though Qualcomm’s baseband processor is still a part of cellular phones, it’s a small component relative to the massive computing power and additional features of today’s smartphones.
Nevertheless, Qualcomm is leveraging this essential patent to distort the market for new smartphones by forcing companies that need to license the technology into paying unfair licensing fees and blocking competitors from any size from getting into the business.
Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took an important step toward addressing this anticompetitive behavior, filing a lawsuit to investigate Qualcomm’s licensing practice. Just this past month, a federal court in California rejected Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing the case to proceed.
Between the ongoing FTC lawsuit and a finding last year from the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) that Qualcomm’s unfair licensing practices warranted a fine of nearly $1 billion, it appears that competition regulators are beginning to take seriously longstanding complaints about Qualcomm’s behavior.
At issue are Qualcomm’s control of Standards Essential Patents (SEPs). As new technologies develop, industry-wide organizations often create standards that manufacturers can follow to ensure interoperability and promote efficiency. When a standard includes a patented technology that is deemed essential for conforming to the standard (an SEP), the patent holder must license the patent under terms that are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (aka “FRAND”). FRAND licensing ensures that industry benefits from consistent production standards while allowing the patent holder to retain control of and profit from the essential patent.
But, because SEP owners control such valuable resources, they occasionally try to capitalize on this strong position by ignoring FRAND obligations or otherwise using their SEPs to reap outsized profits, such as when Qualcomm has refused to license its baseband processor patent to competitors, or when it demanded that mobile phone manufacturers agree to unreasonable licensing terms in exchange for access to the patented technology.
Despite scrutiny from the FTC, KFTC and other competition authorities around the world regarding its unfair licensing practices, Qualcomm has indicated that it intends to double down on these questionable business activities to distort competition in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). Considering the vast economic potential of the IoT sector, the consequences of this anticompetitive behavior should concern companies and consumers alike.
It appears likely that small innovators will have an outsized role in developing the IoT market, with venture investors putting more than $1 billion into IoT startups in 2016.  According to Gartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory company, “makers and startups, not tech providers, consumer goods companies or enterprises, will drive acceptance, use and growth in the IoT through the creation of a multitude of niche applications.”
If Qualcomm exports its anticompetitive licensing model into the IoT sector, this incredible economic potential will be at serious risk. Unfortunately for startups, investors and consumers, Qualcomm has already begun to push its IP might in IoT, joining forces last September with Ericsson, ZTE and Royal KPN to license its patents to “automakers, creators of smart meters, and others,” through a new company called Avanci.

When Avanci was announced, the company’s leaders, “stressed that the pricing will be based on FRAND terms and the rates will be made public.” But if history is any indicator, potential licensees should be concerned that FRAND terms will not be available without a fight — if reasonable terms are available at all. As other commenters have noted, this consortium is “far from the new start the IoT needs,” since “the companies behind Avanci are all traditional mobile players with significant patent portfolios to protect and monetize.”
Startup activity in the mobile and IoT sectors depends on fair licenses for SEPs. Regulators must keep a watchful eye on bad actors to ensure that innovators are not precluded from bringing products, services, apps and new innovations to market simply because large players can leverage IP rights to box out potential competition.
The FTC lawsuit provides an opportunity to address unfair licensing practices and set the stage for more open innovation in developing sectors. Now that the case is set to proceed, we look forward to an open debate on the best path forward for both license holders and license seekers. We should strive to limit barriers to open competition like unreasonable patent licensing practices in order to allow the next generation of startups and entrepreneurs to build upon the innovations of the past.",2017-09-11,1538817,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/robot-blinders.png?w=738,mobile/,"zte,ericsson,qualcomm",When modern day innovators begin to stray,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/when-modern-day-innovators-begin-to-stray/
Josh Constine,Apps,"Subverting the 140 character limit by chaining tweets together into a cohesive “tweetstorm” takes some know-how, or you’ll screw it up. Luckily Twitter has built but not yet launched a feature for easily composing tweetstorms. Hidden inside the current Android app is a way to write out a tweetstorm and see it broken into distinct tweets, then tweet them all at once.
By institutionalizing tweetstorms with a graphic user interface, Twitter could make sharing expanded thoughts more accessible to everyone. Whether it’s telling a suspenseful story, stringing together breaking news facts, or going on a long-winded rant that should have been a blog post, tweetstorms let you distribute deeper and more nuanced content.
Under the pseudonym Devesh Logendran, a Twitter user passed on their sighting of the tweetstorm feature to TNW’s Director of social media Matt Navarra. Twitter told us “No comment to share on the record” when we asked about the feature that refers to tweetstorms as “threads”. We have no additional information on if or when this feature will ever launch, but have learned that it’s not currently available for public testing.
Popularized by tech investor Marc Andreessen, coined by fellow VC Chris Dixon, and vilified by BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel, tweetstorms have been a Twitter power user trick since at least 2014.
Typically, you need to know to reply to you previous tweet one at a time to build a tweetstorm, not just tweet separately or reply the first tweet. A lot of people make these mistakes, causing their storms to get broken up in the timeline.
Whether making tweetstorms easier is good for the information density and consumption trends of Twitter is up for debate.
Some think you should either condense your thoughts into a tweet or two, or right a separate blog post and link to it. Others think the serialized format can offer a special reading experience and reach a wider audience than an offsite blog. Either way, the Twitter sorting algorithm deemphasizes content with weak feedback, so if tweetstormers are boring their audience, they’ll pay the price in visibility.

But one of Twitter’s core problems is that it doesn’t feel approachable for the average joes and janes, leading to its weak user growth the last few years. Seeing tweetstorms and not understanding how they work, or messing up when you try yourself can discourage people from sticking with the app.
Twitter’s already made a wise push to simplify itself in other ways, like dropping media embeds or usernames in replies from the character count. Launching a tweetstorm button could remove one more confusing block from the wall dividing Twitter from the mainstream.",2017-09-10,1538527,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/twitter-lightning.png?w=738,mobile/,,Twitter has an unlaunched tweetstorm feature,twitter,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/tweetstorm-button/
Matthew Lynley,Mobile,"Barring Apple coming out with a delayed launch date for the next-generation iPhone, the guts of which are basically laid out on the Internet already, Apple’s shares are probably not going to see the kinds of explosive activity you might expect around something as hyped as a massive iPhone revision.
Instead, Wall Street — which has spent months and months modeling Apple’s future, reading the tea leaves, and trying to chase down as many leads as it can — is walking into the event on Tuesday with as much of a good idea as the average consumer that reads, say, TechCrunch. Since these expectations are set, there typically aren’t any real surprises Apple could come out with that would force Wall Street to reassess the future of the company, and thus send the stock swinging upward or downward.
This is actually one of Apple’s biggest challenges and, in recent quarters, is often cited on conference calls for the companies’ quarterly earnings reports. Leaks for the next-generation iPhone are more prolific than ever. Given that the upcoming iPhone may end up having significant updates and changes, it would make sense that it would generate enough of a hype aura to get people to hold off on purchasing phones in the near term.
Still, just by reviewing what’s happened in recent years, you don’t see any significant stock swings following each event. Let’s go back through some of the previous years, starting with the 2013 iPhone 5S announcement:

The iPhone 5S was an incremental update to the iPhone 5 and, as we’ve come to expect, we knew a lot about the phone before Tim Cook actually went on stage and kicked off the event to unveil the phone. Now, let’s take a look at 2014, the last massive revision to the iPhone:

And then 2015, the incremental update to the iPhone 6 with the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus:

And, finally, here’s last year’s launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus:

The trend is normally pretty similar: there might be a small shift on the actual day of the event of a few percentage points, which is maybe followed by an extended euphoria period as Wall Street starts to come in with estimates of iPhone sales and their projections for the third quarter. Then, there’s a bit of a hangover period as the company starts to march toward its earnings report, which is typically where the real fireworks happen.
This is more or less a similar sentiment to what Wall Street has, which is tracking the same reports and is looking at the same tea leaves the average consumer is in order to divine where to value Apple as it heads into the fourth quarter. But in this case, the surprise last quarter was that Apple forecast a quarter that was a bit above what everyone expected — and, hence, would theoretically deliver the new iPhone on time.
That’s why the release date is going to be critical for the iPhone. Apple came out with some numbers that made Wall Street rethink what the company is going to do in the third quarter and the kind of results they expect to see. If that ends up not fitting the model, then they have to change the model, and then we’ll see a shift.
That’s now baked into the anticipation around the Apple event. New cameras are great, faster processors are also nice, but at this moment it seems there are few surprises that might come out about the actual guts of the device. Instead, most eyes will be on that date that Apple puts on screen for when consumers can finally begin ordering the new iPhone, and when it will begin shipping.
Apple had to constantly grapple with intense consumer demand for Plus models of the iPhone as consumer demand for larger phones seemed to far outstrip what everyone thought. Every week the shipments get pushed back is another week that consumers are going to have to wait, and it’s another week that the price tag will seem even more ominous if it ends up higher than what they are typically paying when they purchase a new iPhone.
So, don’t hold your breath for anything other than the final launch date (and maybe the price) of the iPhone X if you’re looking for something insane to happen on Wall Street. See y’all on Tuesday!",2017-09-10,1538506,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-634120922.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"iphone-x,finance,iphone-8",Don’t count on any Apple fireworks on Wall Street next week,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/dont-count-on-any-apple-fireworks-on-wall-street-next-week/
Natasha Lomas,Gadgets,"We are but days away from the event of the Apple calendar year when the company pulls the curtain up on new iPhone models. And yet the leaks keep coming.
The latest juicy tidbit is what looks to be the official names of the three models Apple is rumored to be announcing next Tuesday — and they suggest Cupertino is skipping its usual ‘S’ generation convention for this release, as well as throwing in a curve ball christening for the most expensive model of the trio.
The top-of-the-range iPhone, which is expected to ditch the home button to make way for more screen real-estate, replacing the fingerprint-powered Touch ID with a facial recognition alternative, has been referred to as ‘D22’ in a leaked iOS 11 firmware build.
But according to a developer who’s being sifting through the firmware the official name will be the iPhone X. 
Which is at least not iPhone Ferrari, as was another of its rumored codenames.
While the other two iPhone models are set to be named the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, according to the leak, meaning Apple is eschewing an iterative iPhone 7s/7s Plus release — underlining how the company wants this release to be interpreted; i.e. not at all iterative.
At this point you do have to wonder whether Apple is retiring the iPhone ‘s’ cycle for good — something TC’s Editor in Chief Matthew Panzarino was calling for back in 2015 at the time of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
After all, when you’re asking people to shell out as much as $1,000 or more for their next smartphone — as has been the rumored price-tag for the incoming iPhone X — there’s rather a lot of perceived value resting on a name.",2017-09-09,1538365,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/512267806.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"iphone-x,iphone-8,iphone",And now the names of Apple’s new iPhones look to have leaked…,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/and-now-the-names-of-apples-new-iphones-look-to-have-leaked/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"Another iPhone 8 leak ahead of Apple’s fall event next Tuesday when it’s official expected to unveil its new flagships: 9to5Mac has been digging through the Golden Master build of iOS 11, and pulled out a few new nuggets of intel about the incoming top of the range iPhone (code-named D22).
We’ve also confirmed with a source that the firmware release being looked at here is the real-deal.
The biggest leak might well be the names of the new devices, which include iPhone 8 and iPhone X.
One incoming feature that could prove popular with iPhone users — especially if it’s not limited to only the very top-of-the-range iPhone model — are animated, 3D emoji characters for iMessage which it says are called Animoji (these are referred to as Jellyfish in iOS 11 release). Including an incoming animated poo-moji, pictured in still 3D form above.
There’s also a GIF of a few others in action…
It says the Animoji will use facial tracking and the user’s voice to create expressive animated messages. So augmented emoji messaging here we come.
9to5Mac has also unearthed a bunch of new and rather retrotastic-looking still wallpapers incoming — and for a couple of these Apple appears to be getting perilously close to recreating the ZX Spectrum logo.
I mean, spot the difference…
Incoming iOS 11 wallpaper:

Ye olde ZX Spectrum logos (as seen via a Google search):

[Insert: Thinking emoji face right here… ]
Moving on, a camera-related feature apparently coming to the new premium priced iPhone model is a Portrait Lighting mode for creating “dSLR-like shots”, as 9to5Mac terms it, using depth by simulating different lighting effects.
9to5Mac notes there’s support for Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light evident in the leaked build, and suggests the mode enhancement could be related to the flash when shooting.
It’s also found new video recording resolutions and capture speeds:
Per prior rumors, the iPhone 8 is expected to see Apple switch from LCD displays to OLED — and 9to5Mac says it’s seeing evidence the OLED iPhone will feature a True Tone Display for white balancing like the iPad Pro lineup. While it reckons the new resolution will be 1125×2436 based on this firmware.
The firmware also includes further references to the new iPhone screen design with the distinctive top notch — first revealed back in July, via the release of firmware for Apple’s forthcoming HomePod Siri speaker.
One of these new reference images apparently shows an SOS mode that can be triggered by pressing what looks like the power and upper volume keys on either side of the iPhone at the same time.

It says there’s also a clue that the power button will play a larger role for interacting with iOS now that Apple is ditching the home button on the OLED iPhone — per earlier rumors.
So, for example, double-clicking the side button (as this key is now apparently being called) will show Apple Pay cards and passes, as is the case on the Apple Watch. 9to5Mac says you can also press and hold it to invoke Siri. Which does make me wonder whether you’ll have to talk to Siri every time you want to turn your top-of-the-range iPhone off.
The side button method is also apparently tied to new Accessibility settings for adjusting the speed of the double and triple click, enabling Type to Siri, and even using Face ID (more on the latter below).
Instead of a home button at the base of the screen, the new premium iPhone 8 is also rumored to be getting a dynamic area/status bar at the bottom of its near bezel-less display.
And this firmware leak appears to confirm the change — with this region being denoted by a line at the bottom of apps:

 
The earlier HomePod speaker firmware leak also confirmed rumors that Cupertino is bringing a facial recognition feature for unlocking the device to the iPhone 8.
Now, 9to5Mac has found a video tutorial for setting up the face unlock feature, which appears to show that users will be guided through capturing their visage — starting with a full frontal and then tilting to the sides, up around and down…
It reckons the face unlock feature, which is codenamed Pearl ID in the leaked firmware, will be officially called Face ID in Apple’s marketing.
Last but not least: As well as iPhone tidbids, 9to5Mac says the iOS 11 GM has leaked what looks to be an image of the new LTE Apple Watch Series 3, which sports a red spot on the digital crown — presumably to help it stand out from existing, non-cellular Apple Watch models.

For further proof, it’s also found a watchOS screenshot of Control Center with a cellular signal indicator (as well as the ‘notch’ OLED iPhone icon).
Other references suggest the watch will share the same phone number as the connected iPhone, as you’d expect. And there are indications some carriers intend to offer promotional plans for the device.
Elsewhere on the other hardware front, 9to5Mac has unearthed what it reckons is a minor tweak coming to AirPods, with a revised version number (1.1 to 1.2) and a video suggesting Apple is moving the charging indicator light from insight to the front of the device so you don’t have to pop it open to check if your earbuds are juiced up yet.
It says it’s still digging through the firmware so may have more tidbits to detail. Although iPhone fans don’t have long to wait for the real-deal big reveal. And of course TechCrunch will be on the ground in Cupertino on Tuesday to bring you all the news as we get it.

Lucas Matney,Mobile,"In the aftermath of the Note 7 debacle, many wondered whether the Note line was done for good. It seems that the latest iteration — despite carrying a high starting price of $930 — has delivered a win for the folks at Samsung. Today, they announced that its pace for U.S. pre-orders of the Note8 have eclipsed those of every other Note release to date.
Now, generally that’s the case with every follow-up to flagship phones from Apple, Samsung and a select few others, but the fact that Samsung was able to put Explodegate behind it in such quick order, largely — I would imagine — thanks to the device’s huge new 6.3″ infinity display, is pretty impressive.
Once recalls were put in place for the Note 7 about a month after it first went on sale in 2016, there were 1 million devices that had to be returned, so that gives us some rough idea to the phone’s early sales.
“We’re thrilled to see the strong consumer response to the next level Note,” Samsung exec Tim Baxter said in a statement.
In my colleague Brian Heater’s review of the device, he declared, “The Note is back, and that’s good news for those who had to give up their beloved device, kicking and screaming. Samsung’s a bit wiser for its sins of the past, and the product is now subject to some of the industry’s most rigorous testing.”
The Note8 will be available in retail stores starting September 15, which is incidentally the same day that the official U.S. recall of the Note 7 was put in place.",2017-09-08,1538121,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/note8_ts_009.jpg?w=738,mobile/,,Samsung is selling Note8 pre-orders faster than any Note before it,samsung,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/samsung-is-selling-note8-pre-orders-faster-than-any-note-before-it/
Josh Constine,Advertising Tech,"WhatsApp is preparing to finally monetize, and its first move follows the same strategy as Facebook Messenger. TechCrunch has discovered code in Facebook’s ad manager that lets businesses buy ads with the call to action “Send WhatsApp Message.”
We reached out for comment and a WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch “We’re testing a new way for people to start a chat with a business in WhatsApp from a Facebook ad. This makes it easier for people to connect with businesses that they care about on WhatsApp.” They clarified that for now, WhatsApp isn’t selling ads on its own app, but testing a WhatsApp chat button on Facebook ads that directly opens a conversation with a business in WhatsApp.
The Next Web’s Matt Navarra initially spotted the WhatsApp name in Facebook’s ad manager code, in a way that didn’t describe how the ads work. Upon further investigation, TechCrunch found this “Send WhatsApp Message” code.

This week WhatsApp announced its plan to eventually charge businesses, stirring worries that businesses might be able to cold-message users with sponsored message ads. But WhatsApp tells TechCrunch that businesses will only be able to contact WhatsApp users that have agreed to be messaged by initiating the conversation. That’s the same way Facebook Messenger-sponsored messages work, where businesses can pay to reconnect with people they’re already chatting with.
So, a business could use the tested Facebook ads feature to get users to spark conversations with their company, and then have the ability to contact them in the future, potentially through sponsored messages. For example, an e-commerce business could buy Facebook ads that start a conversation with its style consulting service on WhatsApp, then later message that user with promotions for new clothing lines.
This was the first way Facebook Messenger began monetizing in 2015 though “Click-To-Message” ads that lived on Facebook proper. Messenger eventually began injecting display ads into the inbox, which WhatsApp could one day allow, too. Alternatively, it could charge large enterprises like banks or airlines for special management of high volumes of messages or e-commerce and customer service transactions.",2017-09-08,1538057,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/whatsapp-money1.jpg?w=738,mobile/,facebook-messenger,WhatsApp’s first ads appear on Facebook and start convos with businesses,"facebook,whatsapp",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/whatsapp-ads/
Sarah Perez,Media,"Last November, YouTube began supporting HDR for those who watch its videos via their TV sets. Today, the company announced it’s expanding the technology to mobile, initially on select Android devices, but not yet on iOS. With support for HDR, videos offer better picture quality, with higher contrast that allows you to see more vibrant colors and make out more of the image in darker scenes.
At launch, YouTube mobile HDR is rolling out to Pixel, LG V30, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note8 and Sony Experia XZ Premium devices, through the YouTube mobile app.
The company says it will continue to work with mobile industry partners to bring HDR playback to more devices over time. The plan is to support new HDR capable devices as they enter the market. (YouTube’s HDR requires VP9 Profile 2.)
When HDR first launched on YouTube, it was only being used by select YouTube channels, including those like MysteryGuitarMan, Jacob + Katie Schwarz and Abandon Visuals.
The technology is still not broadly adopted, but YouTube today points to a few other resources for finding HDR quality videos, including on Youtube.com/4K or HDR shelf, as well as in videos such as Venice Carnival in 4K HDR 60P (UHD), The Redwoods | Shot on Epic-W with HELIUM 8K S35 Sensor 8K HDR, and Peru 8K HDR 60FPS (FUHD).

HDR is still an up-and-coming technology, in terms of TVs. Though there are plenty of HDR TVs to choose from, most consumers don’t upgrade their television set that often. In other words, when something like 4K or HDR hits, it could be years before it reaches the masses.
Right now, it seems that HDR TV sets will surpass 4K sets, with shipments reaching 245 million units by 2022.
However, making HDR video available via mobile could broaden its adoption, given that many consumers already have these devices in hand, and phones are swapped out on a more frequent basis.
Following the launch of HDR, YouTube has been working with creators who want to take advantage of the technology. It made HDR recording gear and post-production facilities available in some of its YouTube Spaces, including New York, L.A., London, and Tokyo. In addition, all YouTube spaces have cameras capable of capturing the requisite dynamic range and RAW/Log format to take advantage of HDR.
YouTube also tells us it’s looking to upgrade Rio and Paris to HDR-capable post production facilities next, and those upgrades should be complete next year.
Google had also previously made it possible to stream HDR content to TVs via its Chromecast Ultra device.
YouTube mobile HDR is rolling out now to the supported devices.

Sarah Perez,Apps,"Zelle, the PayPal rival backed by more than 30 U.S. banks, is preparing to launch its standalone mobile app on Tuesday, September 12th. The move is meant to give the U.S. banking industry a foothold in the person-to-person payments business, where they’re losing ground to services like PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash and, very soon, Apple’s iMessage, powered by Apple Pay.
While banks have always offered the ability to do instant transfers, the process to date has been more cumbersome. Users would need to have details like a friend’s account number and routing information, for example. That led to the birth of alternative means of sending money, like today’s payment apps where you only need to know information like a username, phone number or email.
Similarly, Zelle’s new app will allow users to send and request money to and from their contacts, using only their phone number or email. It also will work with U.S. Visa and MasterCard bank debit cards, even if the user’s bank is not yet participating in Zelle’s payment network.
That network has been in the works since 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase first teamed up to work on a digital payments solution that would allow their customers to send money to each other through a joint venture then called clearXchange. The consortium dragged its feet, but last year picked up momentum and rebranded to the consumer-friendly “Zelle.”

This June, Zelle announced it would become available within the mobile banking apps of participating financial institutions. So far, 13 banks and credit unions added support for Zelle in their own mobile apps, and 17 more have plans to connect with Zelle, according to Early Warning Services, the big bank-led consortium that operates Zelle’s network.
Since that rollout, Zelle says the supported banks and credit unions have seen up to 300 percent increases in new customer enrollments, and an average of more than 50,000 new customers are now enrolling with Zelle daily. The larger plan is to bring Zelle to the 86 million mobile banking consumers in the U.S.
In the new app available on Monday, Zelle users will be able to send instant funds to one another for free, provided both are signed up for Zelle.
If the recipient doesn’t have access to Zelle through their bank or credit union, however, transactions will take between 1 and 3 days to complete. But unlike PayPal and Venmo, the transfers hit the other person’s bank account more immediately — there’s no final “transfer to bank” step the recipient has to take to have access to the funds.

The Zelle network already has a sizable user base making instant payments. In the first half of this year, the banks connected through Early Warning handled 100 million instant payments, totaling $33.6 billion — largely before Zelle became available.
However, Venmo processed $17.6 billion in mobile payments last year, and is increasing that number. In Q2, Venmo saw $8 billion in transactions, or twice as much as the same time last year. And for the first half of the year, Venmo totaled $14.8 billion in payments.
PayPal, which also owns Venmo, has been working to counter the Zelle threat. It announced in June that it’s also bringing instant bank transfers to PayPal and Venmo, but will charge a flat $0.25 fee for the option. So far, only PayPal has gone live with the new feature.
Correction: app launches on Tuesday, not Monday. apologies for the error. ",2017-09-08,1537907,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/banking-zelle.png?w=738,mobile/,"payments,zelle,venmo","Zelle, the U.S. banks’ Venmo rival, will launch its mobile app next week",paypal,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/zelle-the-u-s-banks-venmo-rival-will-launch-its-mobile-app-on-monday/
Darrell Etherington,Gadgets,"

Cinematic camera maker RED has a smartphone on the way – the Hydrogen, which boasts a great video camera as well as a “holographic display” that we know relatively little about, despite MKBHD getting some hands-on time with the phone ahead of its release. Now, we know more because RED CEO Jim Jannard named HP Labs spin-out Leia Inc. as the display tech partner (via Engadget).
Leia’s technology works using light field technology, which stacks LCDs with backlights pointing in different directions. When you combine the angles of the backlight projecting the images on screen, you can produce 3D effects visible by the naked eye. Leia’s innovation is making this work while also keeping the traditional 2D display capabilities undisturbed, so that you can switch between both modes depending on what you’re viewing.
The major hangup for content viewable on the holographic screen might be on the content side, however – Jannard said that the smartphone will use a holographic format called .h4v to render 4D content on the screen. Creators can shoot 4 cameras simultaneously from different angles to capture these playable holographs, which seems like a steep requirement for amateurs, or by converting traditionally captured 2D or 3D content, though converting 2D content is quite difficult.
At the very least, this doesn’t sound like it will be quite as gimmicky as the holographic screen on Amazon’s Fire phone, which offered very little in the way of ‘wow’ factor. But it’s still going to be a niche product – unless you happen to be receiving an intergalactic SOS from the namesake of Leia Inc.’s brand.",2017-09-08,1537856,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/leia-tech-display.gif?w=640,mobile/,red,Here’s how RED’s holographic smartphone display will work,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/heres-how-reds-holographic-smartphone-display-will-work/
Matthew Lynley,Gadgets,"Fitbit today came out with some additional news that might give Wall Street some signs of life as it looks to compete with an increasingly complicated fitness tracking environment — and the stock is surging this afternoon as a result.
Fitbit’s shares are up more than 11 percent after it announced a partnership with Dexcom, which would introduce glucose monitoring on the Ionic Smartwatch. This somewhat nudges Fitbit beyond just fitness tracking into something that’s more in the vein of health tracking in general. Starting in 2018, the Fitbit Ionic will show users data from a Dexcom G5 mobile sensor. It’s a collaboration that’s aimed at developing and marketing products to better manage diabetes.
Fitbit is well known for its fitness trackers, but increasingly there’s been a proliferation of trackers that focus on all areas of health. The Apple Watch is trying to move further into something that’s broader than simply fitness, and there are startups like Proof looking to pick away little niches like tracking blood alcohol content. The sum of all these little niches may end up as a comprehensive health tracking device, though cramming them all into one piece of hardware may prove more challenging than initially expected.
It’s a nice jump and a reprieve from a pretty ho-hum month for Fitbit, which has seen a slight bump in its performance.

Still, any sign of life that alters the calculus of the kind of business Fitbit can build means there’s likely going to be a big stock price swing like we’re seeing today. Fitbit has barely sustained “unicorn” status, but it’s nowhere near where it was when it went public, and has had to fight to convince Wall Street that it’s a real, healthy company.",2017-09-07,1537477,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/fitbit_ionic_3qtr_sport_adidas.jpg?w=738,mobile/,dexcom,Fitbit is surging after it announced a big health partnership,"fitbit,apple-watch",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/fitbit-is-surging-after-it-announced-a-big-health-partnership/
Romain Dillet,Apps,"Apple is holding a keynote today at the brand new Steve Jobs Theater on Apple Campus, and the company is expected to unveil new iPhone models, a new Apple Watch as well as a new Apple TV. At 10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris), you’ll be able to watch the event as the company is streaming it live.
You know what September means. It means that Apple is about to unveil a new iPhone. But this year is going to be different as the company should unveil not one, not two but three different models. There should be a new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as well as a mysterious iPhone X. There were many leaks already, but some details are still unclear. Also, you can count on a new Apple Watch as well as a much more powerful Apple TV. It’s going to be a packed event.
If you have the current Apple TV, you can download the Apple Events app in the App Store. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old events. Users with old Apple TVs can simply turn on their devices. Apple is pushing out the “Apple Events” channel so that you can watch the event.
And if you don’t have an Apple TV, the company also lets you live-stream the event from the Apple Events section on its website. This video feed only works in Safari and Microsoft Edge; the good news is that it works on macOS, iOS and Windows 10 – chances are you have at least one device running Safari or Edge.

Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"It’s easy enough to put an always-on camera somewhere it can live off solar power or the grid, but deep in nature, underground, or in other unusual circumstances every drop of power is precious. Luckily, a new type of sensor developed for DARPA uses none at all until the thing it’s built to detect happens to show up. That means it can sit for years without so much as a battery top-up.
The idea is that you could put a few of these things in, say, the miles of tunnels underneath a decommissioned nuclear power plant or a mining complex, but not have to wire them all for electricity. But as soon as something appears, it’s seen and transmitted immediately. The power requirements would have to be almost nil, of course, which is why DARPA called the program Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operation.
	
The sensor is built to detect infrared light waves, invisible to our eyes but still abundant from heat sources like people, cars, fires, and so on. But as long as none are present, it is completely powered off.
But when a ray does appear, it strikes a surface is covered in tiny patches that magnify its effect. Plasmons are a sort of special behavior of conducting material, which in this case respond to the IR waves by heating up.
“The energy from the IR source heats the sensing elements which, in turn, causes physical movement of key sensor components,” wrote DARPA’s program manager, Troy Olsson, in a blog post. “These motions result in the mechanical closing of otherwise open circuit elements, thereby leading to signals that the target IR signature has been detected.”
Think of it like a paddle in a well. It can sit there for years without doing a thing, but as soon as someone drops a pebble into the well, it hits the paddle, which spins and turns a crank, which pulls a string, which raises a flag at the well-owner’s house. Except, as Olsson further explains, it’s a little more sophisticated.
“The technology features multiple sensing elements—each tuned to absorb a specific IR wavelength,” he wrote. “Together, these combine into complex logic circuits capable of analyzing IR spectrums, which opens the way for these sensors to not only detect IR energy in the environment but to specify if that energy derives from a fire, vehicle, person or some other IR source.”
The “unlimited duration of operation for unattended sensors deployed to detect infrequent but time-critical events,” as the researchers describe it, could have plenty of applications beyond security, of course: imagine popping a few of these all over the forests to monitor the movements of herds, or in space to catch rare cosmic events.
The tech is described in a paper published today in Nature Nanotechnology.",2017-09-11,1539117,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/neu_pmr_coverart_1.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,darpa,This tiny sensor could sleep for years between detection events,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/this-tiny-sensor-could-sleep-for-years-between-detection-events/
John Biggs,Gadgets,"As a fan of electronic guitars — as opposed to plain-old electrics — the Jammy seems like a very interesting piece of kit. Designed to be played like a regular guitar, you fret on the top part of the neck and strum the strings on the bottom half. Because it has only five frets you change the octave by pulling the neck out from 0 to the full length of 12 inches.
Design house RnD64 created the Jammy and will be shipping it later this year. There’s no pricing and the website features a vague promise of a special price if you leave your email address, which suggests this is a bit of a fishing expedition — that expandable neck is probably a bear to engineer. That said, I’m a sucker for wild music ideas, and this fits the bit.
“Direct audio output allows you to stream music straight into your earphones or amp, no smartphone or tablet needed,” wrote the creator Dmitry Shemet. “You can play in a stand-alone mode or jam along with a virtual backing band — Jammy’s onboard presets provide you with the bunch of unique guitar sounds — from classical nylon strings to heavily distorted metal tones.”

Romain Dillet,Gadgets,"The current Apple TV is nearly two years old. That’s why it’s not surprising to learn that Apple has been working on a new device for a while. This weekend, an upcoming build of iOS 11 for the next iPhone was leaked and contains a ton of information about unreleased products, including the next Apple TV.
A previous leak of the HomePod firmware already indicated that Apple was working on an Apple TV with 4K video support. The new device could also support various high-dynamic range standards, such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Hybrid Log-Gamma. The company could announce 4K videos on the iTunes Store as well as in the Netflix app.
And now, Steve Troughton-Smith discovered some of the technical specs of the next Apple TV. According to him, the media player is going to receive a major performance gain with a lot more computing power and RAM:
Apple first shipped the A10 with the iPhone 7 last year. The A10X is an updated version of this chip optimized for the most recent iPad Pro. It’s a surprisingly fast system-on-a-chip. It’s sometimes even faster than a MacBook.
The current Apple TV sports an A8 system-on-a-chip, the one that was developed for the iPhone 6. It’s a bit hard to grasp Apple’s progress when it comes to silicon. According to Geekbench, when you compare the A10X with the A8, the A10X is 1.7 times faster for single-core tasks, 2.8 times faster for multi-core tasks and 5.7 times faster for Metal-focused, GPU-intensive tasks. It’s a huge improvement overall.
This upgrade in particular is going to feel great when you’re trying to stream 4K videos. Skipping forward and backward should feel snappy. And your videos will never buffer, even if you’re trying to play 4K videos with 60 frames per second (the new iPhones should let you shoot 4K videos with 60 FPS).
In addition to a faster system-on-a-chip, Apple could also include 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. This way, you’ll be able to cache a good chunk of the movie or TV show you’re currently streaming.
Apple could announce the new Apple TV as early as tomorrow during its annual September press conference. The company could also use this opportunity to showcase some new video games running on the Apple TV as it’s quite a capable device now.",2017-09-11,1538735,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/apple-tv.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"iphone-8-event,rumor","Get ready for a new, much more powerful Apple TV","apple-tv,apple",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/get-ready-for-a-new-much-more-powerful-apple-tv/
Natasha Lomas,Gadgets,"We are but days away from the event of the Apple calendar year when the company pulls the curtain up on new iPhone models. And yet the leaks keep coming.
The latest juicy tidbit is what looks to be the official names of the three models Apple is rumored to be announcing next Tuesday — and they suggest Cupertino is skipping its usual ‘S’ generation convention for this release, as well as throwing in a curve ball christening for the most expensive model of the trio.
The top-of-the-range iPhone, which is expected to ditch the home button to make way for more screen real-estate, replacing the fingerprint-powered Touch ID with a facial recognition alternative, has been referred to as ‘D22’ in a leaked iOS 11 firmware build.
But according to a developer who’s being sifting through the firmware the official name will be the iPhone X. 
Which is at least not iPhone Ferrari, as was another of its rumored codenames.
While the other two iPhone models are set to be named the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, according to the leak, meaning Apple is eschewing an iterative iPhone 7s/7s Plus release — underlining how the company wants this release to be interpreted; i.e. not at all iterative.
At this point you do have to wonder whether Apple is retiring the iPhone ‘s’ cycle for good — something TC’s Editor in Chief Matthew Panzarino was calling for back in 2015 at the time of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
After all, when you’re asking people to shell out as much as $1,000 or more for their next smartphone — as has been the rumored price-tag for the incoming iPhone X — there’s rather a lot of perceived value resting on a name.",2017-09-09,1538365,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/512267806.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,"iphone-x,iphone-8,iphone",And now the names of Apple’s new iPhones look to have leaked…,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/and-now-the-names-of-apples-new-iphones-look-to-have-leaked/
Devin Coldewey,Gadgets,"Magnetic storage, and we’re talking tape here, is good for long-term storage because it’s cheap and stable — unlike solid state drives and volatile memory, which are quick but expensive and better for temporary storage. New research might lead to a method that combines the best of both worlds.
The main problem with magnetic storage is that it tends to require a charged coil that must physically move to the location on the disk that it needs to write to and directly switch the direction of magnetization. Solid state storage lets the file system write to anywhere in its many gigabytes instantly. It’s like the difference between writing down an address and driving to it.
But if magnetic storage could be stored as addressable cells, it would be quick to write but would maintain its 1 or 0 status indefinitely. That’s what the researchers at ETH Zurich are attempting to do — and have done, at least with a single cell.
Instead of having a coil touch a magnetic medium, a tiny cobalt dot 500 nanometers wide sits near a platinum wire. When electricity flows through the wire, stray electrons with spin opposite that of the cobalt accumulate at the edge, and eventually cause the whole dot to flip its magnetic orientation.
The team demonstrated this back in 2011 but just published a new paper showing how fast this whole thing happens — they watched it by blasting it with a scanning microscopic x-ray machine, which is pretty awesome. Turns out the whole bit flipping process takes less than one nanosecond.
Not only that, but they flipped it back and forth trillion (!) times at 20 million times per second, and observed nothing suggesting the effect was weakening or becoming unreliable.
They plan to make it even faster and work with a smaller current, and possibly change the shape of the dot — for all they know, a square might flip faster than a circle. My guess is that they’re putting off the really hard part, which is putting billions of these things in a huge, addressable array. Not much use storing a single 0 or 1 — I can do that with a coin.
Ultimately this or a technology like it could lead to instantly writable but enduring storage that requires no power to keep its data intact; it could be used as RAM or long term storage, assuming it gets cheap enough to use for either. That’s for them to figure out.
The research is detailed in the latest issue of the journal Nature Nanotechnology.",2017-09-08,1538245,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/magnet.jpg?w=738,gadgets/,eth-zurich,Zapping cobalt nanodots could lead to magnetic RAM,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/zapping-cobalt-nanodots-could-lead-to-magnetic-ram/
Matt Burns,Gadgets,"The American Red has teamed up with the UPS Foundation and drone manufacturer CyPhy Works to bring drones to sites of natural disasters. The goal is to use drones tethered to the ground to assess damages through constant aerial observations. This is where CyPhy Works comes in.
The pilot program utilizes CyPhy Works’ Persistent Aerial Reconnaissance and Communications (PARC) platform. In this test the platform will provide constant power to a drone flying stationary at 400ft through the use of a tether. Since the drone is tied to the ground, constant power can be provided from a ground-based generator thus providing uninterrupted surveillance for days or weeks at a time. A 30X zoom camera will then be used to surveil tens of miles around the drone and would be able to assess the impact of a disaster to best direct relief efforts and later to accelerate insurance payout.
The parties involved agreed to launch a one week, onsite trial in an area heavily flooded by Hurricane Harvey. If successful, it could be used again following Hurricane Irma.
The Boston-based CyPhy Works has been testing this tethered platform in different scenarios. During Forth of July fireworks and the Boston Marathon, CyPhy works provided hours of aerial surveillance to the Boston Police Department.

Cinematic camera maker RED has a smartphone on the way – the Hydrogen, which boasts a great video camera as well as a “holographic display” that we know relatively little about, despite MKBHD getting some hands-on time with the phone ahead of its release. Now, we know more because RED CEO Jim Jannard named HP Labs spin-out Leia Inc. as the display tech partner (via Engadget).
Leia’s technology works using light field technology, which stacks LCDs with backlights pointing in different directions. When you combine the angles of the backlight projecting the images on screen, you can produce 3D effects visible by the naked eye. Leia’s innovation is making this work while also keeping the traditional 2D display capabilities undisturbed, so that you can switch between both modes depending on what you’re viewing.
The major hangup for content viewable on the holographic screen might be on the content side, however – Jannard said that the smartphone will use a holographic format called .h4v to render 4D content on the screen. Creators can shoot 4 cameras simultaneously from different angles to capture these playable holographs, which seems like a steep requirement for amateurs, or by converting traditionally captured 2D or 3D content, though converting 2D content is quite difficult.
At the very least, this doesn’t sound like it will be quite as gimmicky as the holographic screen on Amazon’s Fire phone, which offered very little in the way of ‘wow’ factor. But it’s still going to be a niche product – unless you happen to be receiving an intergalactic SOS from the namesake of Leia Inc.’s brand.",2017-09-08,1537856,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/leia-tech-display.gif?w=640,gadgets/,red,Here’s how RED’s holographic smartphone display will work,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/heres-how-reds-holographic-smartphone-display-will-work/
