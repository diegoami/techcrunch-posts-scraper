Jon Russell,Asia,"Regular run-ins with government regulators and battles with well-funded local rivals have made Asia challenging terrain for Uber. The challenge is such that it’s fitting that the U.S. ride-sharing giant has hired a man who once scaled the summit of Mount Everest to lead its business in the region.
Brooks Entwistle, a former Chairman of Goldman Sachs Southeast Asia, was announced today as Uber’s Chief Business Officer, Asia Pacific.
“After twenty years working in Asia, I couldn’t turn down the opportunity of shaping how the region moves over the next twenty,” Entwistle, who joins Uber from PE firm The Everstone Group, said in a statement.
In the role he’ll be responsible for business development, corporate development and marketing across Asia, excluding India and China, the latter being a market where Uber is no longer present. Interestingly, Uber said Entwistle will have a focus on “autonomous vehicle alliances.” While Uber has made progress on self-driving cars in the U.S. through its Otto unit — now known as Uber ATG — the company has yet to make a move in Asia, unlike rival Grab which partnered with MIT spin-off Nutonomy last year.
Also notable in Uber’s announcement are plans to “explore new opportunities to invest and grow our presence through strategic partnerships and investment opportunities.”
That looks like Uber will be doing investment deals across Asia, helping it catch up with a strategy that Grab has used in Southeast Asia to expand its business beyond merely ferrying passengers from point A to point B.
Grab is developing a payment platform to help reach users and develop increased loyalty, and it has put particular emphasis on Indonesia — the region’s largest economy. Earlier this year, Grab announced a $700 million program dubbed ‘Indonesia 2020,’ which includes an allocation of upwards of $100 million for investment in startups and other local initiatives.
Grab quickly got into that budget with the acquisition of Kudo, which sources told TechCrunch was priced at $80 million-$100 million, but it has indicated an interest in deploying more capital to help spread its base and business.

Uber may well be looking to follow in Grab’s footsteps and make investments of its own to growth its marketshare, which indicators suggest has fallen lately as Grab — which recently raised $2 billion from Didi and SoftBank — has pushed the accelerator to the floor.
Entwistle will also have government relationships to work out. Just this week Uber was suspended in the Philippines for a month, it is also currently out of action in Macau and has been knee-capped in Taiwan, where it recently returned with a licensed taxi service after UberX was ruled to be illegal. It has also scrapped with regulators in Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia among other places over the past year.
With talk of a potential Uber exit from Southeast Asia in some media, there’s also an argument that Entwistle could be a deal-maker who looks for the kind of amicable departure that Uber found in China last year and again in Russia this year.
Such talk ballooned up after Grab raised its recent funding round and, while watching a key ally refuel its war chest is a blow, Uber’s position across Southeast Asia isn’t so far behind that it should needs to concede. However, if it deems itself to be losing ground in the U.S. then it isn’t impossible to imagine resources being diverted to protect that the home turf above all others.
But there’s much more to come in Southeast Asia where the ride-hailing industry is only getting started. A 2016 report co-authored by Google forecast that annual revenue could surpass $13 billion by 2025, up from an estimated $2.5 billion in 2015.",2017-08-16,1527903,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/uber-support-ios.jpg?w=738,asia/,"asia,transport,topography",Uber’s new head of Asia is a former Goldman exec who once climbed Mount Everest,uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/uber-asia-brooks-entwistle/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Tencent, Asia’s highest valued technology company, posted a record quarterly profit of $2.7 billion (18.2 billion RMB) thanks to explosive growth from mobile games.
The firm’s profit in Q2 2017 rocketed 70 percent year-on-year on the back of the success of Tencent’s mobile games, particularly smash hit Honour of Kings which claims over 200 million registered users.
Honour of Kings, the world’s highest-grossing mobile game, helped the Tencent mobile gaming business eclipse total income from its PC gaming business for the very first time, growing 54 percent to hit 14.8 billion RMB, $2.2 billion. That mobile gaming figure represented a large chunk of Tencent’s overall quarterly revenues of 56.6 billion RMB ($8.49 billion) for the quarter — that figure is up 59 percent annually.
PC games were no slouch, pulling in 13.6 billion RMB ($2 billion) in revenue for the period. All in all, Tencent said its online games business grossed 23.9 billion RMB ($3.6 billion), with growth climbing seven percentage points to reach 39 percent year-on-year growth.
There is some uncertainty going forward, however, since Tencent began to limit how much time users aged 18 and below can spend inside Honour of Kings and other titles. The limitations were announced in July, and while CEO Pony Ma said in a statement today that they will “ensure users play games in a healthy manner,” it remains to be seen whether (and how) revenue will be impacted.
Outside of games, Tencent said its WeChat messenger app, which dominates China, was also a star performer. Its monthly active user count reached a new high of 963 million, although growth slowed from 34 percent last year to 19.5 percent.
Tencent doesn’t disclose how many of that WeChat userbase is based in China, where it offers a rich set of services that better monetizes users, while it is also selective with the financial information it reveals around the app. It did state, though, that WeChat advertising was a key factor in growing its social advertising business to 6 billion RMB ($900 million), up 61 percent annually.
Revenue for Tencent’s general online advertising business, which is anchored by its video and news services, was up 55 percent to 10.1 billion RMB, or $1.5 billion. Other revenue, which includes its aggressively marketed cloud computing service and payment services, more than doubled to reach 9.7 billion RMB ($1.5 billion).

Jon Russell,Asia,"Ant Financial, the Alibaba affiliated valued at $60 billion, is continuing to follow Chinese tourists and their wallets overseas after it inked a deal with Yelp in the U.S..
The partnership allows Alipay users — and there are over 500 million registered in China — to make payment through the service when they use Yelp for restaurant bookings. The launch initially covers restaurants in New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco, but there are plans to expand more widely across the country.
There are also plans to launch a version of the app that is translated into Mandarin Chinese to help travelers.
This tie-in follows a major expansion from Alipay in the U.S. in May. The Chinese firm teamed up with First Data in a move that brings support for its mobile payment system to point-of-sales systems of more than four million retail partners in the U.S.. That’s a peg that this Yelp deal is hanging on, since the integration will only work for Yelp restaurant partners that accept Alipay.
Alipay also massively increased its potential with global retailers looking to reach Chinese consumers online when Stripe added support for its service earlier this summer. Stripe also added rival WeChat Pay from Tencent to its roster.
Together Alipay and WeChat Pay control over 90 percent of the mobile payment market in China. Increasingly they are casting their nets overseas to follow Chinese tourist spending which is predicted to grow significantly.
A recent report co-authored by Visa estimates that Chinese travelers’ overseas spending came in at $137 billion in 2015. That figure is forecast to increase by 87 percent over the next decade, taking China’s spending to double that of the U.S., and more than the UK, Russia and Germany combined.",2017-08-16,1527425,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/alipay-logos.jpeg?w=738,asia/,"yelp,ant-financial,alibaba-group,e-commerce",Alipay partners with Yelp to continue its pursuit of Chinese tourist money,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/alipay-partners-with-yelp/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Uber has suspended its services in Philippines after the national regulator banned it from operating for one month.
The country’s Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) ordered a cease and desist against the U.S. ride-hailing firm on Monday over its apparent flouting of a ban on new drivers. The company initially lodged an appeal and continued with its service, but today it confirmed it issued a “temporary” suspension from 7:30 pm local time on Tuesday.
“We are disappointed with the LTFRB’s decision to deny our Motion for Reconsideration, and will comply with the Order. We look forward to urgently resolving this matter, and thank the public for its support over the last 24 hours,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.
The issues stem back to July when the LTFRB requested that Uber and rival Grab both stop allowing new drivers on to their services to give it time to catch up on a backlog of applications for drivers seeking ride-hailing permits.
The companies were reportedly fined close to $100,000 each for enabling large numbers of unregistered drivers to work. They were told to clean up their act and were permitted to register new drivers, so long as they didn’t hit the roads and work until the green light was given by authorities. Uber appears to have breached that agreement, while Grab — which remains open as usual in the country — told TechCrunch that it has not.
Grab said it has “adjusted” its prices to include a cap on surge fees in order to manage what is likely to be a lot more demand.
“In light of the recent order of the LTFRB, we find ourselves in a unique situation. We ask the patrons of ride-sharing to bear with us as there has naturally been an increase in bookings made on the Grab platform,” a spokesperson said.
A unique situation indeed — a world without Uber… just for a month and just in one country, at least.
The Philippines has blossomed into one of the most notable ride-hailing markets in Southeast Asia, particularly in capital city Manila. Alongside Singapore, it was one of the first two markets in the region where Uber reached profitability, as TechCrunch reported last year, while the country is understood to account for a sizable portion of revenue for Grab, too.
Uber has run into issues across Asia, but recent hotspots have included Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong and Thailand.",2017-08-15,1527408,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-696041476.jpg?w=738,asia/,"car-sharing,commuting,business,transport",Uber suspends its service in the Philippines following ban over unregistered drivers,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/uber-suspends-its-service-in-the-philippines/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Apple continues to be locked out of China’s massive mobile payments space. The latest reminder came this week when Beijing’s transportation system opened up to smartphone payments… via an Android app.
Already Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay services dominate China’s mobile payment space, which is estimated to have processed $3 trillion last year, but now Apple has missed out being part of what is sure to be a very convenient usage case.
The Financial Times reports that Beijing’s public transport payments company Yikatong launched an app for ‘most’ Android devices that allows commutes to ditch their physical card and pay fares via their phone.
Apple isn’t included most likely because its operating system doesn’t support third-party payments like Yikatong, instead favoring its own Apple Pay. But it is also worth noting that iOS accounts for just 16 percent of all smartphones in China, according to data from Kantar as of March. Though the figure in urban areas is likely to skew in Apple’s favor, it doesn’t dominate which may be another factor.
It’s unclear whether potential iPhone owners would go to the lengths of buying an Android device just to use the transportation app, but it’s another piece of anecdotal evidence that shows the difficulty Apple is up against in China, where revenue was down 10 percent year-on-year in its most recent quarter of business.
Apple recently removed the popular tip feature from chat app WeChat, a move that some believe might tempt its users to move over to Android where it continues to exist. While WeChat itself, far and away the most popular Chinese app, has ‘leveled the playing field’ in some ways by standardizing parts of the mobile experience for users whether they are on iOS or Android, the latter of which is often (far) cheaper.
That said, analysts are optimistic that the forthcoming next iPhone — which has been heavily linked with a range of new features — can sell well in China if Apple is able to differentiate it from previous models. Time will tell, but missing out on wide deployments like Chinese public transport remains a blow.",2017-08-15,1526992,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beijing-subway.jpg?w=738,asia/,"mobile-payments,computing,smartphones,technology",Beijing’s public transport system gets an app for paying fares — but Apple isn’t invited,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/beijing-public-transport-app/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Uber has inspired countless businesses to adopt its asset-light and on-demand approach to their industries. The examples are countless. Food delivery, dry cleaning, jet planes, home services rental bikes, or even phone chargers to name but a few — but how about farming equipment?
That’s the case in India, where a startup called EM3 AgriServices is helping rural farmers literally get their hands on specialist (and expensive) equipment and machines that would ordinarily be out of their reach. The goal is to help them earn their livelihood with cutting-edge tech without breaking the bank.
The concept is actually quite straightforward. EM3 works with farmers who own equipment like tractors, harvesters and other mechanical implements by allowing them to ‘rent’ out their assets to help pay off the purchase or generate additional revenue. Farmers, typically those in remote regional with small holdings and limited capital, then get access to quality implements and machines on a pay-as-you-use basis on either an hourly or acreage pricing.
That’s important when most farms in India are smaller than three acres. Tight economics, and a reliance on loans to make big-ticket purchases, are thought to be a key factor responsible for a high level of suicides among farmers over the past twenty years.
“The average Indian farm holding is just one percent of what you’d find in U.S., so farmers aren’t able to afford technology, even basic mechanization, because the capital load is too high,” EM3 founder and managing director Rohtash Mal (pictured above) told TechCrunch in an interview.
And he should know. Mal, a 63-year-old self-confessed “corporate world veteran,” started EM3 with his son Adwitiya Mal (CEO) in 2013 after a spell in charge of agriculture machinery manufacturer Escorts gave him a glimpse into the struggles of Indian farmers.
“In the farm equipment business one thing became clear, we did everything we could to help customers buy our products, but the fact is that the small farm could not afford the rate of technology,” Mal senior said.
“We’re inspired by what happens in tech world, but this hasn’t been done in agriculture before. The need wasn’t there in a lot of markets, such as the U.S., which were the foundation heads of technology, but the need is here in India,” he added.
The company calls its business farming-as-a-service — or Faas.
Unlike Uber, which has pioneered an online business model, EM3 is ‘tech-enabled’ rather than ‘tech.’ That’s to say that while it uses common on-demand tech to manage supply-demand, customer data and more, the majority of its business is offline. That’s because, quite simply, its customer base remains disconnected from the internet.
“The majority of farmers are not on smartphones,” Mal junior said. “The smartphone penetration is increasing but it isn’t at critical mass yet so we have a physical on the ground presence.”
So where there are apps for those ahead of the curve, EM3 operates call centers for handling requests from farmers — both inventory owners and prospective renters — and it deploys local representatives in the villages that it serves. But even the select farmers who are online and own smartphones find something comforting and secure about talking to a person on the other end of the phone when it comes to business matters that impact their life, the EM3 execs said.

To date, EM3 has focused on central parts of India where it claims to have worked with 8,000 farms through its 10 service centers. Mal senior explained that its platform covers machinery and services that span all seasons, but customer activity levels do vary during different parts of the farming calendar and based on location, crop type, etc.
The startup recently partnered with the local government of Rajasthan, India’s largest province by size and a major agriculture producer, to make a push into helping thousands more farmers. It is planning further forays, too, after raising significant funding from investors.
EM3 closed a $10 million in Series B financing led by Global Innovation Fund and VC firm Aspada which will be put to work expanding into more regions, increasing its inventory and developing tech. EM3 previously raised a $3.3 million Series A round led by Aspada in 2015.
Further down the line, Mal senior said he can envisage its business moving into other areas of a farmer’s business where it believes it can add value.
“There’s no other company [offering this service yet, but I’m sure there will be me-toos,” he said.
“We are still significantly ahead, but will have to add more and more to the menu of services to keep our lead. We want to become more dedicated to the farmer and look for more opportunities in farming and adjacent spaces.”
Already there is competition with Gold Farm and Trringo, a subsidiary of automotive conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra, opening similar services over the past year.
Interest in agritech in India has heated up in recent years. Earlier in 2017, Accel backed AgroStar, a startup that offers a range of guidance and e-commerce services targeted at rural farmers, in its first deal in the sector. Plenty of other VCs in the country have expressed their interest about getting into the space, which has the potential to harness the power of technology to help many farmers in a profound way.",2017-08-15,1526956,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/em3.jpg?w=738,asia/,"business,renting,battery-charger,energy","In India, an Uber for farm machinery aims to make a difference in rural areas",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/em3/
Jon Russell,Asia,"India-based messaging app Hike is back on the acquisition trail after it picked up Creo, a hardware company that previously released smartphones, streaming devices and an operating system.
The price of the deal is undisclosed. Hike released a short statement late on Friday announcing the acquisition, although it does not appear that the 50-person Creo will continue to work on hardware.
“The Creo team will begin work on a developer platform to enable third party developers to build services on the Hike platform,” a Hike spokesperson said.
Creo recently slashed the price of its Mark 1 smartphone, and it confirmed on its website that it will be its last.
“To build our next product, we need all the focus and good luck we can. Owing to this, we will no longer be making new CREO Mark1 devices or releasing any software updates,” it wrote on its website.
Bangalore-based Creo was founded in 2013, it had raised $3 million and it has plenty of links with Hike. Founders Sai Srinivas Kiran G and Shubham Malhotra are former Hike employees, while Hike CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal is one of its investors alongside major names like Sequoia.
Unsurprisingly that led to plenty of rumors of an acquisition, with The Ken reporting last October that a deal was close. Bharti Mittal rejected the deal at the time saying that Hike talks to many companies at any given time.
The deal is Hike’s third acquisition. It bought WiFi calling startup Zip Phone in 2015 and live-streaming company Pulse, although it has not confirmed the latter deal. It was valued at $1.4 billion following a $175 million investment by Tencent last year. It has raised $261 million in total.",2017-08-11,1526124,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/hike2.jpg?w=738,asia/,"creo,software,technology,computing",Indian messaging app Hike acquires hardware startup Creo,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/hike-creo/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Now is a good time to be in the co-working industry in Southeast Asia, it seems. Barely days after WeWork announced plans to enter the region, which is home to over 600 million people, through the acquisition of Singapore startup Spacemob, now a company that operates like an Airbnb for office space rentals has raised money.
FlySpaces, a startup headquartered in the Philippines, raised $2.1 million this week in funding round described as pre-Series A.
The company operates a service that aggregates a selection of co-working spaces in six cities across Asia — Manila and Cebu in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong/Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. It was launched in 2015 with $500,000 in initial financing, and CEO and co-founder Mario Berta was previously with Rocket Internet’s Uber rival Easy Taxi.
While its core focus is office space rentals, Berta told TechCrunch that FlySpaces has diversified into other enterprise verticals including event venues, retail space and corporate dining. He said other expansions may see it move into billboard spaces.
“We’re looking at how we can cross sell other things into this space once we acquire a customer,” Berta said.
On the business side, the FlySpaces makes money through commissions on bookings made through its site. It retains a cut when a customer that first found a space through its service signs on for a longer leasing, Berta confirmed. That seems essential when most people might book a day or another short lease to test an office before committing to a longer booking. In addition, the company also runs some ads selectively, but that accounts for less than 25 percent of income.
Berta said his company is already profitable but it sought out investment to ramp up its growth through hiring, increased marketing and product development. The backing comes from undisclosed players in the retail space — although one named investor Net Group co-president Raymond Rufino — because Berta found that tech VCs “don’t understand” the FlySpaces business. But he admitted that there’s the potential to be more strategic with these backers.
FlySpaces already covers the main markets where English is a primary language for business in Southeast Asia, and Berta said that while there is no immediate plan for further country launches, he’d like to be in all ASEAN countries eventually. That’ll necessitate moves into Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia at some point.
Speaking generally on the industry — which now includes WeWork in Southeast Asia — Berta said that one of his biggest frustrations is that co-working spaces are commonly thought to be focused on tech startups and freelancers. A point he said isn’t true.
“It’s huge misconception, the money is in SMEs and corporates,” he argued. “It’s ideal for companies who don’t want to invest in capex and want to maximize their office space.”
Some of the customers that have used FlySpaces include Google, P&G, Media Corp and Uber, according to its website.",2017-08-11,1526022,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-566352405.jpg?w=738,asia/,"coworking,business","FlySpaces, an Airbnb for office space in Southeast Asia, raises $2.1M",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/flyspaces/
Jon Russell,Asia,"China continues to crack down on online media after the government announced that it is investigating three of the country’s most influential social networks for hosting illicit content.
The Office for Cyberspace Administration is looking into content on chat app WeChat, micro-blogging platform Weibo and web forum Baidu Tieba, each of which stands accused of failing to stamp out material that “jeopardised national security,” the BBC reports.
Principally that includes content related to terrorism, pornography and other obscenities, the office said. Companies like Tencent, which is Asia’s most valuable tech company, and Weibo already aggressively police content on their platforms, but evidently aren’t doing so at a level that pleases the government.
The crackdown follows the closure in June of around 60 celebrity gossip accounts on WeChat, China’s largest messaging app with over 600 million users. The influential accounts were accused of disseminating similarly illegal content. The agency said at the time that media should “actively propagate core socialist values, and create an ever-more healthy environment for the mainstream public opinion.”
Today’s news follows a major setback for free speech in China when Apple pulled a range of popular VPN apps from its Chinese App Store. The apps allow people to circumvent China’s ‘Great Fire Wall’ internet censorship system, but Beijing has outlawed any that do not operate with government-approved permits.
China recently upgraded its censorship apparatus to add new capabilities that have allow it to partially disrupt communications made through WhatsApp and WeChat. That’s of course in addition to blocking websites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google as well as media including The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

Jon Russell,Asia,"This week seems to be a good one for media streaming companies in Asia. Hot on the heels of Malaysia-based Iflix raising $133 million for its Netflix-like service for emerging markets, Hong Kong’s PCCW has pulled in $110 million for its range of video and music streaming services.
Hony Capital, which recently backed WeWork’s China business, Foxconn Ventures and Singapore sovereign fund Temasek have taken an 18 percent share in the PCCW International OTT business. PCCW Media, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will retain majority ownership.
The business operates three digital products, video streaming service Viu, short clip service Vuclip and music service MOOV. Viu is available in 15 countries in Asia and the Middle East with 12 million monthly active users. It takes a hybrid model offering both paid subscriptions and ad-supported user options. Vuclip, which was acquired two years ago, differentiates by offering shorter videos in 19 countries across India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
On the music side, PCCW Media has MOOV which is available in Hong Kong. It expanded to Vietnam last year, where the firm sees potential among a young popular with booming 3G data subscriptions.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Janice Lee, PCCW Media managing director, said the business didn’t need to raise capital since it is funded by its parent, but the deal is driven by potential synergies.
“We saw that there are strategic investors we feel we are very complementary [and] playing in different parts of the OTT space. Foxconn is a transforming company [while] Temasek and Hony have [backed] companies that have been successful in the media space,” Lee said.
Foxconn in particular, which is best known as a key Apple manufacturer, could open the door to hardware products in the future, although didn’t elaborate on that in detail.
“It’s a direction where we see cooperation,” she said. “There are definitely commercial synergies to working together.”
Indeed, Foxconn has made a sustained push into internet-of-things and media in recent times. That’s particularly clear with its investments, which have included Chinese dock-less bike rental company Mobike, audio maker Devialet, next-gen display startup DigiLens, Indian chat app Hike and SoftBank’s colossal $100 billion Vision Fund.
PCCW Media has aggressively expanded its video services with a pipeline of market launches over the past year or so, and Lee said that the primary focus now will be getting deeper into its existing markets. There may still be country launches, but adding new content — including the company’s own original productions out of Hong Kong and markets like India and Indonesia — is the immediate priority alongside product development and localization tweaks.
The overall strategy is to take a local approach to content — not unlike Iflix — to gain engagement in individual market. Already though, PCCW Media claims its most engaged users are on its service for upwards of 1.3-1.8 hours per day, consuming more than 15 videos per week.
As for MOOV, PCCW Media has been more measured with its approach with just two active markets.
“We selectively assess where we go next,” Lee explained, since the company believes that, for now in Asia, “video is much more ready for monetization for both advertising and subscriptions.”",2017-08-10,1525535,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screenshot-2017-08-10-19-36-58.png?w=738,asia/,"distributed-computing,iflix,pacific-century-group",PCCW Media raises $110M for its video and music streaming services in Asia,netflix,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/pccw-media-raises-110m/
Jon Russell,Asia,"A young startup in India wants to makes autonomous driving technology more widely available for truck operators, especially those outside of the U.S., by lower the cost significantly.
The concept of self-driving trucks sat in the background for some time as the vision of autonomous cars ferrying consumers from A to B hogged the limelight, but the potential for trucking is at least on par if not higher — particularly on a global level. Beyond potential safety gains, integrating elements of autonomous car tech can help boost efficiency, too.
Thus far the technology has been pioneered in Silicon Valley, where giants like Uber and Google are working on bringing the tech into trucks — via their Otto (now Uber ATG) and Waymo business units, respectively — while Tesla is preparing to enter to foray. All these solutions require expensive kit that isn’t deployable on all vehicles. That combination means it is likely to be out of reach for most of the world’s trucking community once it is finally available on a commercial basis.
That’s where Flux Auto, a 16-person startup based in Bangalore, hopes to make a difference by democratizing autonomous systems. It is developing technology that, when finished, could enable any kind of truck to be retrofitted with self-driving car technology at a far lower price.
To make its tech accessible, Flux Auto has had to make a compromise. It doesn’t use Lidar — Light Detection and Ranging — sensors which have become the standard for autonomous vehicles, but are incredible expensive. Waymo CEO John Krafcik recently revealed a Lidar would cost $75,000 a few years ago, but these days he claims it is just 10 percent of that price. Even still, at $7,500 it remains prohibitively costly for many truck operates — and that’s just one component.
“While the competition is focusing on LIDAR technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time. This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a LIDAR system,” Flux Auto founder Pranav Manpuria explained to TechCrunch.

Uber ATG’s trucks use a Lidar mounted above the cab
Flux Auto is looking at a product that would retail for around $3,000-$4,500, the price range would be dependent on the level of features a customer wants.
The system is being developed to handle cruise control, lane keeping and collision avoidance. Like Uber AG and Waymo, the idea is to take the strain off of drivers and help make journeys more efficient.
“We’re using cameras along with other sensors — sonar, radar, ultrasonic, etc — to understand everything that’s happening around the vehicle, and make decisions based on that,” Manpuria said. “We’re developing our entire tech stack as an after market accessory. This allows us to target the massive market of already existing commercial vehicles.”
Manpuria, who graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology and previously ran a payment startup, said the company is looking to raise around $1.5 million to fulfill its goal of deploying its systems on trucks in a range of markets beyond India. Initially it began testing on cars, but it has just equipped its first truck (see above) for the next stage of testing before the end of this month.
Money from investors will go towards expanding the team and developing its technology. Flux Auto is aiming to deploy its tech on 2,500 vehicles within the next twelve months. That’s likely to necessitate a U.S. office, and Manpuria said the business may need to migrate to the U.S. to continue its development in the future. That’s particularly true if India bans autonomous cars, as its transport minister has threatened.
“I’ve been very interested in self-driving and it’s benefits for a while now. However, working on a self driving car didn’t seem appealing since car owners would be reluctant to spend a few thousand dollars on technology where the benefits to them aren’t that obvious,” he said.
“Where this technology makes the most sense, and can have the biggest impact is the trucking industry — and the benefits we provide with our technology are worth an investment into it by truck owners,” said Manpuria.",2017-08-10,1524040,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/flux-auto-1-crop.jpg?w=738,asia/,"entrepreneurship,transport,business,economy",Indian startup Flux Auto wants to democratize self-driving tech for trucks,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/flux-auto/
Jon Russell,Asia,"SoftBank missed out on getting a piece of Flipkart when its deal to acquire Snapdeal, the e-commerce firm which SoftBank backed in 2015, fell apart last month, but the Japanese tech giant has finally gotten there.
 Flipkart today confirmed that SoftBank has invested in its business, via its $100 billion Vision Fund, as part of an extension to the $1.4 billion financing round which was announced in April.
The Vision Fund is buying a mix of primary and secondary sales, but the size of the investment is not disclosed. All that both sides said is that the deal is the largest private investment in an India-based tech company, and that it makes the Vision Fund “one of the largest shareholders in Flipkart.”
Citing sources, India’s Economic Times reported that the deal is around the $2.5 billion mark. SoftBank and Flipkart both declined to comment.
Flipkart did say that the fresh injection leaves it with over $4 billion on its balance sheet. That’s a pretty handy arsenal for battling Amazon’s India unit, which CEO Jeff Bezos has committed to continuing to fund after already injecting some $5 billion to date. This extension also adds SoftBank, a major global influencer, to the already-stellar names of Microsoft, Tencent and eBay which participated in Flipkart’s April funding round.
That deal was a record Indian investment at the time, so SoftBank is spending at least $1.5 billion this time around. It could well be more — much more. Bloomberg reported at the end of July that the two sides were in talks over a potential $2 billion investment and now Economic Times is saying it is higher still.
“India is a land of vast opportunity. We want to support innovative companies that are clear winners in India because they are best positioned to leverage technology and help people lead better lives. As the pioneers in Indian e-commerce, Flipkart is doing that every day,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement.
Beyond press speculation, a deal seemed on the cards when Son admitted his interest in Flipkart at an investor meeting this week. He also went public with his intention to invest in Uber — another much-rumored deal — although he also admitted that SoftBank is studying a potential deal with Uber’s U.S. rival Lyft.
The Vision Fund announced an initial $93 billion close in May, but SoftBank is targeting a total close of $100 billion. The fund includes Apple, Qualcomm, UAE-based Mubadala Investment Company, Saudi Arabia’s PID public fund, Foxconn, and Foxconn-owned Sharp among its LP base. Early deals include ARM, Nvidia, Roivant Sciences, Improbable, Brain Corp, Plenty, SoFi and Guardant Health.
There are so many, we actually made a gallery.
One area the fund is not investing in ride-sharing companies. That’s been left to SoftBank itself, which owns stakes in Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and 99 (Latin America).",2017-08-10,1525486,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-681409878.jpg?w=738,asia/,"accel-partners,economy,softbank-group,business",SoftBank’s Vision Fund backs Flipkart in record India tech investment,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/softbank-flipkart/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Sony said today that it has finished developing a digital system for storing and managing educational records on the blockchain. The Japanese firm is now looking to commercialize the product, in partnership with selected educational institutions, next year.
The idea — which was first announced 18 months ago — is to make use of the blockchain as a centralized ledger for storing educational information, such as degrees, diplomas, tests and more, as a kind of ‘digital transcript.’ Sony said the system has been developed to prevent fraud, while providing access to third-parties for job interviews and assessment among other purposes.
The idea is to improve on current practice of storing candidate education histories within individual schools and institutions themselves, which requires records to be shared over email or by a physical copy. It believes that there’s a modern alternative. Sony’s blockchain-based system instead allows data from various institutions to mix together, making it more convenient and easier to share or track a person’s ‘live’ resume.
For example, securing partnerships with universities and high schools would mean candidates school and graduation records are baked into their profile and accessible to third parties, such as when applying for jobs or further education. Then there is the potential to add bespoke testing and other information.
Beyond making it easier to share information, Sony said also that the stored data sets could potentially be analyzed using AI to provide feedback and improvement ideas for educational institutions and their curriculums and management.
That’s the theory for now, and it of course requires execution to get the product to market and deliver on its potential. To that end, Sony said it is aiming to partner with educational institutions and “tailor the service to their needs.” The goal is a live launch sometime next year, but it will trial the new system for its Global Math Challenge, a worldwide competition that takes place later this year.
The system is managed by Sony Global Education, and is built on top of IBM Blockchain using IBM’s Cloud and The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 framework.
What’s particularly notable about the project is that Sony believes it can be expanded into other areas of digital asset management, including IoT, logistics, digital content, real estate and (more obviously) cryptocurrencies.",2017-08-09,1525028,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/sony.jpg?w=738,asia/,"sony,computing,technology",Sony wants to digitize education records using the blockchain,bitcoin,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/sony-education-blockchain/
Jon Russell,Asia,"A month after committing to help WeWork enter Japan, SoftBank is lending a hand to another global unicorn with its sights set on the country. Today, it announced a tie-in that will bring Ofo’s dock-less bike rental service to Japanese soil.
Ofo, which has raised more than $1 billion from investors such as Alibaba, Didi Chuxing and DST Global, claims over 100 million registered users and eight million bikes, each of which can be left anywhere and hired by scanning an attached QR code via the Ofo app.
Ofo will work with SoftBank C&S — the firm’s division responsible for IOT, robotics and the cloud — on the Japan launch. The initial plan is to bring Ofo’s bikes to Tokyo and Osaka in September ahead of a presumably wider expansion that will happen at a later date.
“Launching in Japan is a huge milestone for Ofo. In a country where there is a strong
cycling culture, we strive to further improve the convenience and cost-effectiveness that
cycling can bring to people in Japan,” Ofo’s head of APAC Lawrence Cao said in a statement.
Unlike the WeWork deal there is no financial aspect to this partnership — at this time, at least. There are already plenty of synergies though. SoftBank has made a number of investments alongside Alibaba, which led Ofo’s most recent $700 million funding round, and it is an investor in Didi, which backed Ofo last year.
Indeed, media reports in recent weeks have speculated that SoftBank may lead a new $1 billion-plus round for Ofo so this Japan launch could mark the start of a longer term relationship between the two.
Ofo is targeting an ambitious goal of reaching 200 cities in total by the end of this year. It hit 100 locations — which was its original goal for this year — within the first half of 2017, with most of those areas being in China. Now it is looking overseas with an aggressive slate of launches likely to come. So far, its international expansion plans have seen it enter, or get close to entering, the UK, Singapore, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and now Japan.",2017-08-09,1525033,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/photo-18-06-2017-11-38-19-am.jpg?w=738,asia/,"ofo,softbank-group,business,economy",SoftBank partners with China’s Ofo to bring its dock-less bikes to Japan,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/ofo-softbank-japan-dock-less-bikes/
Catherine Shu,Asia,"Accelerator network SparkLabs launches its newest program today in Taipei. Headed by managing partner Edgar Chiu (pictured above), SparkLabs Taipei will focus on preparing Taiwanese startups to enter other countries.
Chiu was COO of Taipei-based app developer Gogolook when it was acquired by Naver, one of Korea’s largest Internet companies, in 2013. Afterwards, Chiu became the founding general manager of Camp Mobile Taiwan, a branch of Naver’s mobile app development subsidiary.
“We already have a lot of accelerators in Taipei, but I think there is still a gap for Taiwanese startups that want to go global and I want to see more succeed. I think there’s a lack of experience on how to enter the global market and we want to fix that,” says Chiu.
SparkLabs launched its first accelerator in Seoul five years ago and now has programs in Beijing and Songdo (a new “smart city” built south of Seoul and funded by the Korean government). It will also open a financial tech accelerator in Hong Kong next year. SparkLabs claims that 79% of its 74 graduates have received followup funding and over $195 million in venture capital so far. Success stories from its accelerator include cosmetics company Memebox and online math-learning platform Knowre, both of which expanded into the U.S. with SparkLabs’ help.
SparkLabs Taipei aims to hold its first Demo Day by early next year. Each year it will host two batches of eight to 12 companies for three months. Startups get funding of up to $40,000 in capital in exchange for up to 6 percent in equity, office space and access to SparkLabs’ network of 150 mentors in Silicon Valley, Korea, China and Hong Kong. Chiu says founders will be matched with four to six mentors and encouraged to talk to them weekly.
The small size of Taiwan (total population 24 million) means that startups targeting rapid growth usually need to go abroad, but Taiwan still makes a good test market because of its high smartphone penetration rate and the willingness of users to be early adopters of apps and online services. While Taiwan’s startup ecosystem is frequently compared with other Asian countries, Chiu believes its best role model might actually be Israel.
“Korea was able to develop unicorns within its own markets, but Taiwanese startups should be more like Israeli startups where they had to seek to go global from the outset,” he says.
Chiu cites photo-editing app PicCollage as an example of a Taiwanese startup that found success abroad with 150 million users worldwide. PicCollage’s founders worked and studied in the U.S. before launching the company, but founders who don’t have that kind of experience can learn how to adapt for international audiences, Chiu says.
For example, he notes that Gogolook’s founders were born and educated in Taiwan, but decided early on to launch their main product, caller ID app Whoscall, abroad and seek international investors once they realized unwanted phone calls are a near-universal problem. At Gogolook, Chiu was responsible for securing global partnerships in Japan, Korea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia for Whoscall, which has been downloaded more than 50 million times.
“If you can find international co-founders or partners, then take advantage of that, but if you can’t, you need to be more aggressive to evaluate users from global markets and also do more product testing to know what they really want,” he says.
Taiwan’s tech industry is known for its hardware prowess; one of its most notable hardware startups is electric scooter company Gogoro. Chiu believes Taiwan’s hardware manufacturing resources has the potential to translate into startups that can not only build infrastructure for smart cities, but also integrate software that is frequently updated and adaptable to different markets.
Chiu will work with SparkLabs Taipei’s two venture partners Alex Wu and Tony Ling. Wu is currently vice president of marketing and communications at Newsela and previously worked at Quora, Facebook and Obama for America. Ling was previously managing director at Silver Lake Partners, where he sat on the boards of GoDaddy and IPC Systems. SparkLabs Taipei’s advisory board includes YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, Kabam co-founder Kevin Chou and Charles and Kai Huang, the founders of Guitar Hero’s first publisher RedOctane.",2017-08-07,1524521,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/edgar_at_sparklabs.jpg?w=738,asia/,"edgar-chiu,sparklabs-global-ventures,sparklabs-taipei,sparklabs-global",SparkLabs launches its latest accelerator program in Taipei,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/sparklabs-launches-its-latest-accelerator-program-in-taipei/
Jon Russell,Asia,"A week after its first investment in Europe, Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing is spreading its wings once again after it announced a financing deal with Careem, an Uber rival in the Middle East that is valued at more than $1 billion. The size of the investment was not disclosed.
Yes, Didi is backing yet another Uber rival in another corner of the world.
Aside from Taxify, the Europe and Africa Uber competitor that it invested in earlier this month, Didi has shares in Lyft in the U.S., India’s Ola, 99 in Latin America and Southeast Asia’s Grab. It also owns equity in Uber courtesy of the unique terms of the acquisition of the Uber China business last year.
In that respect, it makes sense that it is considering investments in basically any ride-sharing company in the world. Beyond giving it the potential to expand its service through acquisitions or partnerships at a later, these deals also help Didi — which is the world’s second highest value tech company behind Uber — to put Uber under some pressure. The firm can help its global partners b giving them more money and providing the expertise and tech capabilities that it has developed from serving 400 million users in China.
As the saying goes: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
“Didi Chuxing brings leading edge AI capabilities, insight and expertise to our organization as we enter our next phase of growth,” Careem CEO Mudassir Sheikha said in a statement. “This evolution in our long relationship will enable Careem to more effectively pursue growth opportunities through continued innovation and sustainability.”
Dubai-headquartered Careem started out five years old as a scrappy Uber competitor, but it has grown into quite a formidable business in its own right. Back in June, it raised $500 million from investors that include auto giant Daimler at a valuation of $1.2 billion — that’s up on the $1 billion valuation that it scored when it raised the first part of that round in December 2016. In total, Careem has raised just shy of $570 million to date, and its other backers include Rakuten and Saudi Telecom Company (STC).
As for its business, Careem operates in 80 cities across 13 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It claims to have over 12 million registered customers and in excess of 250,000 drivers. It has even played the Didi big brother role. Back in July, it invested an undisclosed sum into Egypt-based Swvl.
Following this investment Didi said its “global framework of collaboration” now covers over 60 percent of the world’s population across 1,000 cities. That gives a clear insight into what its next ambition is having already driven Uber out of China via that acquisition deal.
Things might be about to get a little more complicated if SoftBank, which has invested alongside Didi in many of its global deals, backs Uber. Following media reports, CEO Mashayoshi Son yesterday confirmed his interest in doing a deal with Uber, but he said that SoftBank is also weighing a deal with Lyft.
Note: This post was updated to correct Careem’s financing history",2017-08-07,1524515,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/pr_1.jpg?w=738,asia/,"careem,didi-chuxing",China’s Didi backs Uber rival Careem to expand its global footprint into the Middle East,uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/didi-backs-careem/
Jon Russell,Asia,"Iflix, an Asia-based startup providing Netflix-like streaming services in emerging markets, has landed $133 million in fresh funding to accelerate its business.
The investment was led by U.S. media conglomerate Hearst, which counts BuzzFeed, Vice and Roku among its investment portfolio. The group was joined by another new backer EDBI — the corporate investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board — alongside undisclosed clients of Singapore-based DBS bank. Existing investors joining included Evolution Media, UK broadcaster Sky, Malaysia’s Catcha Group, Liberty Global, Jungle Ventures and PLDT.
Iflix was started in May 2015, initially in selected Asian markets. Today its streaming service is priced around $3 per month and available in 19 countries thanks to expansions into the Middle East and Africa. The business has raised close to $300 million from investors to date. It started out with a $30 million pre-launch round in 2015, before adding $45 million from Sky last year and completing a $90 million raise in March of this year.
That most recent round valued the company at $500 million, but there’s no word on what the valuation following this new financing is. (We’re working on getting that detail.)
Netflix is the most obvious rival to Iflix but, with over 100 million paying subscribers and 5.2 million new additions in the last quarter alone, few can rival the U.S. media giant. In that respect, more regional competition includes Singapore’s HOOQ, which is backed by telecom firm Singtel, and PCCW Media-owned Vuclip, as well as local single-country streaming services are more valid comparisons.
Iflix said it had five million registered users back in March, but it isn’t giving an update on that this time around. It instead hailed “tremendous growth” which it said includes a 3X increase in subscriber numbers and 2X rise in user engagement over the past year. Revenue, it said, is up 230 percent year-on-year, but it is keeping quiet on raw figures.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Iflix CEO Mark Britt played down inevitable comparisons with Netflix, insisting that the services do not share the same target audience.
“We very genuinely don’t see Netflix as a competitor, we see ourselves as providing a new service for the mass markets,” he said.
Britt explained that Netflix’s model targets the global elite, those with high-end devices like an iPhone, disposable income and a credit card for payment. Iflix, he claimed, is aimed at those with lower-end devices and poorer quality internet access, but a desire to always consume on mobile.
“If Netflix is the iPhone of content streaming, our aspiration is to be the Android,” Britt added. “We’d love to be a secondary choice to the upper socials — if you love Netflix you should probably get Iflix as an addition — but for the mass market, the majority of their consumption is on a mobile device.”

There’s certainly plenty of pie to fight for. A recent report from Media Partners Asia forecast that online video consumption in Asia alone could surpass $20 billion by 2020, although the figure falls to $3.2 billion when China — which is dominated by local players, and where Iflix is not present — is removed.
Nonetheless, Iflix has taken steps that are similar to Netflix. This year it began broadcasting its own original programming — bringing an underground comedy series from Malaysia to its platform earlier this year — and that is expanding to a dozen countries. While in March it hired Sean Carey, who was formerly VP of global television for Netflix, as its own chief content officer. It has also moved into live sport, having captured the rights to Indonesia’s soccer league, and Britt said it is focusing on acquiring more local content, including first releases from cinema’s and local productions.
“We’ve realized the key for us is local content, not the Western content studios — the majority of our top 10 content is regional or local,” he told TechCrunch. “Western content sets the bar for binge-watching, but in terms of reaching the mass market, what’s having a bigger impact is taking content from local cinemas or distributors.”
That’s where this new funding is likely to be put to work, growing that local collection with a focus on exclusives and first-runs. Britt said that Iflix may also look to enter new regions, too, with Latin America on the list of potential entries thanks to its similarities with regions where Iflix already plays.
“The opportunity is very real in emerging markets globally,” he added. “TV has gone from stalling in the last few years to actual decline in most emerging markets. Our understanding of that is that it is actually yesterday’s product [since] the majority of the emerging classes worldwide are aged under 25.”
“We’re the only platform talking with [studios and producers] about what this new experience should look like for these 1.3 billion people [in emerging markets] in the next few years,” Britt said.",2017-08-07,1524169,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-07-08-2017-10-57-07-pm.jpg?w=738,asia/,"business,economy,streaming,iflix",Iflix raises $133M for its Netflix-style service for emerging markets,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/iflix-133m/
Jon Russell,Asia,"SoftBank has confirmed that its 4.9 percent stake in Nvidia is to be transferred to the Vision Fund, its colossal investment vehicle that’s targeting a $100 billion final close.
The Japanese tech firm bought the position in chip-maker Nvidia, which has forayed into AI and self-driving car tech in recent years, back in May for a reported $4 billion. The Vision Fund held the rights to acquire that asset and the transfer was confirmed today in a filing.
The price paid was never disclosed but, with Nvidia’s market cap nearly at $100 billion today, the shares are worth around $5 billion right now. Following the deal, the Vision Fund becomes Nvidia’s fourth largest shareholder.
Beyond Nvidia, the Vision Fund is also picking up SoftBank’s share of medtech startup Guardant Health, which raised $360 million led by SoftBank in May. There’s plenty of cross-over beyond those deals. Previously, Softbank sold one-quarter of ARM, the chip giant it acquired last year for north of $30 billion, to the Vision Fund.
That ARM deal is a key component to the interest in Nvidia. SoftBank CEO Mashayoshi Son explained that Nvidia’s involvement in the Vision Fund makes particular sense because of the relationship that it has with ARM, which licenses its chip design to Nvidia among others. Addressing investors and press at a Q1 earnings event, Son dedicated plenty of time to explaining the Vision Fund which, as he himself admitted, is quite like any other VC investment vehicle in tech today.
Beyond its sheer size, he said that the fund is about developing a group of the world’s best companies to capitalize on the coming “information revolution.” Son explained that neither SoftBank nor the fund will look to take majority ownership in companies or invest strictly for profit, rather the goal is to develop a portfolio of top tech firms that can explore partnerships and synergies to grow together.
“We are ready to create this group and Nvidia is part of that,” he said.
Back when the Vision Fund announced its first close of $93 billion — that also happened in May, it was a busy month — SoftBank disclosed that the fund has the right to buy its stakes in ARM, Nvidia and Guardant Health, as well as Intelsat, OneWeb and SoFi. Expect more share swapping between the two entities going forward.
SoftBank’s other transactions may soon include its first ride-sharing investment in North America, too. Son revealed his intention to cut a deal with either Uber of Lyft — he said a decision hasn’t been made on which one yet. SoftBank is already the majority investor in Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and 99 (Latin America).",2017-08-07,1524046,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-631041028.jpg?w=738,asia/,"nvidia,softbank",SoftBank transfers its $5B stake in Nvidia to the Vision Fund,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/softbank-nvidia-vision-fund/
Jordan Crook,Apps,"Tinder has hit number 1 in the App Store’s top grossing category for the very first time.
Claiming top spot in the App Store likely has to do with the global launch of Tinder Gold, which lets users see who has liked them without swiping at all, among other premium features.
Tinder’s initial foray into monetization came in 2015 with the launch of Tinder Plus, which lets users “Rewind” on accidental left swipes and includes the “Passport” feature, letting users search outside of their current geographical radius.
The company has since added new revenue models, such as advertising within the feed. Plus also includes a limited amount of a la carte paid features, such as Super Like and Tinder Boost. Super Like lets you notify someone you really like that you’re into them before they even swipe on you, marking your profile with a big blue star. Tinder Boost, on the other hand, lets you skip the line and jump to the front of other users’ feeds as they browse the dating service.
While Tinder Gold was in testing in a handful of markets for the past month, the company officially rolled out Tinder Gold worldwide on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Tinder topped the Top Grossing category of the App Store.
App Annie says that dating apps made up one-third of the top 15 apps by iOS revenue yesterday, along with video and music streaming apps. The analytics service also said that Tinder has been in the top 15 iOS apps by daily revenue throughout all of 2017, and hung in the top 10 for July and August.",2017-09-01,1535140,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tinder-gold.jpg?w=738,startups/,"app-annie,ios,tinder-gold",Tinder hits top grossing app in the App Store on heels of Tinder Gold launch,tinder,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/tinder-hits-top-grossing-app-in-the-app-store-on-heels-of-tinder-gold-launch/
John Mannes,Artificial Intelligence,"Lan Xuezhao has spent the last few months pulling together $136 million for her new machine intelligence-focused venture capital fund, Basis Set Ventures. I met Xuezhao for tea on a park bench in Potrero Hill earlier this week to chat about her strategy for the fund.
I spend a good portion of my time meeting with investors, but if you don’t know a lot about the scene, Potrero Hill is not a place you go to meet VCs. Hot spots for meetings generally range from opulent coffee shops in San Francisco to opulent offices on Sand Hill Road. So a park bench in a fairly residential, low-profile neighborhood stands out.
But even more than that, Xuezhao has a surprisingly laid-back demeanor and an apparent academic appreciation for technology. With a PhD in quantitative psychology, the former head of mergers and acquisitions for Dropbox can do something that most other investors cannot — relate to the incredibly talented founders of highly technical startups.
Breaking rank with increasingly flashy, services-focused AI studios like Yoshua Bengio’s Element AI, Xuezhao wants Basis Set to be the anti-VC. Everything blindly promised by AI-focused VCs gets a layer of realism. Data sets: What data, why and does it actually exist anywhere? Technical mentors: How about I just sit down and we both start by being honest with each other — then if we can’t come up with it, let’s text someone who can.
We spent about an hour talking about the state of AI startups and how Basis Set Ventures aims to capture the windfall from the burgeoning space. I’ve edited all remarks for brevity.
TechCrunch: Why did you feel $136 million was the right number to start with? 
Lan Xuezhao: The number is more strategic than anything else. I feel like there’s a gap between Series A and smaller seed deals. There are a lot of smaller seed funds and it’s hard to compete with them because there are so many.
At Series A there are a lot of bigger names who do a very good job with those. But in-between, there’s a sweet spot for checks ranging in size between one and three million dollars. And not that many funds are able to do that.
TC: Can an AI focus still be a differentiator in a market that now seems saturated with AI-focused funds? What do you think is the real value a VC can add to a machine intelligence startup?
LX: Given my experience, I think go to market is the most important because algorithms are less defensible. Being able to help startups close larger clients is something I spend a lot of time on. Startups value me as a thought partner. You don’t have to be very formal with me in terms of presentation or reporting numbers.
I’ll sit down with a founder and we will go through an Excel spreadsheet and figure things out. I’ll help startups recruit people. Those are the resources that people want. I’m very pragmatic; I want to help founders get this stuff done.
The fund is very focused in terms of thesis and size. We do a lot of inbound leads, but we also do a lot of research to ensure our leads are not biased. Every Friday we talk to customers, the real people who actually use these products, and we try to figure out what works best and what doesn’t work at all. A lot of times the products people are using are from companies not based in California. These end up being very helpful conversations.
TC: Is the AI studio model overhyped?
LX: There is value in technical talent. I have advisors and their perspective is very valuable to me. Even product managers and designers, their perspectives are really valuable to a fund. But you want to make sure that these people are involved enough to actually help uncover blind spots.
Some incubators try to provide data which will help companies build early products. I think that’s a little tricky because the data needs to be very targeted. There is a lot of potential for value, but it depends on exactly what a company needs.
TC: Are machine learning APIs and developer tools defensible as investments in the long run?
LX: I’ve seen this approach working for some companies, but I’m a bit torn. I don’t have a strong opinion. It’s truly a case by case basis. I have invested in one company that fits this profile and things are going great for them, but I’ve also heard cases where it’s not working out so well.
I like when companies develop their own technology. The integrations need to be good and the experience needs to be native in order for this to be useful. Developers need to have very strong incentives to make this work. It’s not that easy to get all three, but if you can, companies are in a pretty good position.
TC: Do you agree with the majority of folks opting to invest in verticalized AI over horizontal platforms?
LX: I believe in vertically integrated full-stack solutions. Algorithms are getting more and more commoditized and big companies are trying to do a lot of the horizontal plays. It’s hard to do well there.
TC: Are you OK with startups using off-the-shelf AI tech early on?
LX: You need to be building something that actually solves a problem versus working on tech for three years and building something that people will not use. AI is a path to solving a problem versus the solution. AI is not the goal, it’s something that solves a problem. Having a real product that people will actually use sometimes means using off-the-shelf tech. Then, in the future, when the product actually takes off, you can make the tech more robust.
TC: You’ve been investing in building a quantitative sourcing engine; what’s the real value that it brings? Is this a natural application of AI inside Basis Set?
LX: Quantitative sourcing is a great way to cover blind spots. Each person’s network is limited and biased. It’s a great tool to supplement people’s own network so that you have a shot at seeing something you otherwise might not see. When doing CorpDev for Dropbox, I first hired a PhD from MIT who did a lot of work building us a quantitative sourcing engine. Together we found a lot of interesting companies that we definitely wouldn’t have seen if we didn’t use that engine. This approach won’t replace traditional sourcing, but it’s a really strong tool and I plan to build one for Basis Set Ventures.
A lot of the challenge is finding the right signal. The algorithms themselves don’t actually need to be that complicated. There will be some curve smoothing when we look at growth etc., but most of it is understanding the problem and finding the right signal so that you can get the right trigger set up when something happens. It requires domain expertise in the same way as AI, though.",2017-08-31,1534246,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ai-money-purple-blue.png?w=738,startups/,"venture-capital,basis-set-ventures,artificial-intelligence,finance",Basis Set Ventures gets real to get to the heart of AI startups,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/basis-set-ventures-gets-real-to-get-to-the-heart-of-ai-startups/
Mike Ducker,Startups,"

For a young Youssri Helmy, it was a Tandy Radio Shack (TRS) 80 that first piqued his curiosity in technology. For Wael Amin, it was the Commodore 64 that he received when he was four years old. Indeed, Youssri and Wael developed a passion for using technology to solve some of the world’s toughest problems, and put that passion to work by founding an Egyptian technology company called ITWORX, a firm that would grow to employ more than 800 people with eight offices worldwide.
For Youssef Aly, it was an MSX computer he programmed to show his brother he was the dumbest guy in the world and that Youssef was the smartest. For one of his co-founders, Hamdy Khalil, it was his Atari 2200. They founded eSpace as one of the MENA region’s original “hacker firms.”
As a young PhD student at MIT, Dr. Khaled Ismail was motivated by the engineering challenge of designing the smallest devices possible. This drive led him to create Egypt’s first chip design firm, SySDSoft.
To the concern the parents of 16-year-old Waleed Khalil — the founder of several electronics firms — it was his interest in electricity and the products that use it that launched his journey to develop Olkya, the first electronic products company in Egypt.
A young Alaa Agamawi got his start working for his family business in 1979, which re-sold western computers into Egypt. There, his desire grew to develop Arabic software that could reach the masses in the Middle East and to build an Egyptian technology industry that global markets would notice.
With technology and curious minds, these founders not only built great products and companies, they created the foundation for a strong and resilient technology sector that has been an economic driver and job creator in a country looking for stable footing.
The technology localizer
Alaa Agamawi is one of the pioneering founders of Egypt’s IT sector. Though his family business re-sold western computers in Egypt, he knew that software, not hardware, presented the best growth opportunity. The family business was slow, as English-based software had a small market in Egypt in the mid-1980s. The problem, Alaa saw, was that the operating system DOS did not work in Arabic.
This sent Alaa down a path to lay the foundation of the Egyptian technology industry. In 1982, Alaa founded Arabic Information Systems (Info Arab), which created the first Arabization utility for DOS. He later developed a simple Arabic word processor. Slowly, multinational software companies started to see the Arabic language countries as a viable market and started to approach Alaa to localize their software. In 1986, he developed an Arabized spellchecker for Apple, which was the first systematic Arabic analyzer.
There were several spin-offs from Info Arab from some of the incredible engineers he hired. One of those engineers was Youssri Helmy, who was very interested in graphics applications. Alaa knew Youssri’s curious mind was limited at Info Arab and supported him in his next endeavor.
Putting Egypt’s’ IT solutions on the global map
Youssri Helmy has always been a man ahead of his time, with incredible technology insights and vision. He went to Cairo University at the age of 17 to learn electrical engineering. Youssri thought the classes were a waste of time, so he started to learn about software development on his own at night. While working at Info Arab, Youssri was responsible for porting accounting software to an Apple computer in Arabic. He loved writing software and wanted to know what software Egyptians wanted.
So in the late 1980s, he created an Apple user community called “Apple Pie” in Egypt. He met all 1,000 Apple users in Egypt to understand how they wanted to use their computer. He found that people wanted a bilingual drawing package, and thus his first startup was born. He developed a low-end graphics program that Apple loved, and soon he had a licensing agreement with Apple. Unfortunately, the royalties stopped in 1992 and he had to make important decisions about his future. He was 30 years old and married with a daughter. Luckily enough, he met Wael Amin and they went on to create the largest software outsourcing company in Egypt.
 
Wael Amin was also an overachiever, and at a very early age he saw the power of technology and wanted to harness it. He went to the American University in Cairo (AUC) at the age of 14 and graduated by the time he was 17 in 1993. He then started with Microlabs with two partners, developing software products for the Middle East. Youssri meet Wael and was excited about Microlabs because it was developing Microsoft Windows applications and he thought it would complement its Apple applications, so he bought the company. In a year, they were bankrupt.
One week after the bankruptcy, Youssri and Wael started ITWORX together to use technology to solve problems. A former employee of Youssri’s found a job at Corel in Canada. The company was impressed with this engineer and asked if there were other Egyptian software developers. Soon Youssri was on a plane to Canada and ITWORX had its first customer. The relationship with Corel was not typical for software outsourcing in the 1990s. Corel wanted to produce ideas from ITWORX, which included a video editor that won several awards. ITWORX grew to 1,000 engineers at its biggest in 2001, and was able to launch a couple of spin-offs in the U.S. and Egypt.
The big dreamer 
Dr. Khaled Ismail has always been driven by engineering challenges. Although MIT wanted him to stay on after he graduated with a PhD, he wanted to work for IBM research labs and wanted to push the limits of making chips faster. At IBM he developed about eight patents and set a world record on the speed electronics could move on a chip.
Although Ismail was very successful in the U.S., he wanted to return to Egypt and develop technology products. He founded a couple of companies, including in 2002 SySDSoft, which designed wireless technologies on chips. This type of technology was not heard of in Egypt. Ismail’s goal was having a team of 1,000 highly skilled engineers. In the first week of business, SySDSoft had customers on five continents. In three years he was able to hire 100 amazing engineers. Once they focused on developing the intellectual property based on LTE technology, things really took off for SySDSoft.
In 2010 as consolidation was happening in the industry, Intel approached SySDSoft to acquire them, to which they agreed. In fact, Ismail was negotiating with Intel in the United States as the 2011 revolution was happening in Egypt. Although the revolution slowed down the negotiations, it did not stop it and terms were reached a month after the revolution, even with the lack of Egyptian government creating massive political risk and weekly protests.
The Egyptian hackers
The first computer science program at the university was not in Cairo but at Alexandria University. There were two groups of friends who went to Alexandria University in the 1990s and worked on software problems. One group had Youssef Aly, who would go to the MIT website and look for computer problems to solve; the other group, lead by Hamdy Khalil, would do weekend-long hacker events at his house. During this time, in late 1990s-2000s, an agreement with Microsoft and the government of Egypt was put in place to get rid of illegal software downloads at the universities. Youssef and Hamdy were upset about this and started an open source software and web development endeavor; they called the company eSpace in 2001 with 10 co-founders (not the smartest move at the time).
 
In 2004 they got a big break — an important contract from Unilever that requested a sales automation solution. eSpace decided to do the project at cost, but was able to resell the software; this turned these hackers into a real business. During the next seven years different founders came and went as eSpace grew its reputation in open-source programming. Soon after the 2011 revolution, the government needed to communicate to the citizens about an upcoming referendum and wanted an IT company to do it for free and in two weeks. eSpace took up the job and utilized its hacker culture to complete the platform in a week, for free. eSpace then got eight more election projects from the government as they became the go-to firm for open-source technologies.
Electronics is not just for Asia
At the age of 10, Waleed Khalil took a course on being an electrical technician and fell in love with electronics. In the late 1980s, Waleed would take apart electronic devices and build electronic circuit boards. After high school, Waleed went to Cairo University and studied electronics, but the courses were not interesting; what was more interesting was building products. He was so good at this many of fellow students would ask him to build their electronics graduation projects for them.
Electronics was new to Egypt and he and a couple of students developed the electronics club, in which students with a common passion built sophisticated electronics products in their free time. This group of students had a vision, but most other students just made fun of them, calling them “Einsteins.” This particular Einstein was fortunate to meet with Ahmed Bahgat, who was the founder of a major industrial group. Ahmed gave young Waleed the large task to manage some of his major electronic manufacturing processes. He then joined a company called Metra, which wanted to design and manufacture local circuit boards in Egypt; Waleed became the factory manager and this helped him move toward his passion of building products.
The U.S. company Mentor Graphics then hired Waleed, and he learned how to design software. Waleed knew he was a great engineer but wanted to be a stronger business person. He was fortunate enough to receive the Yousef Jameel Scholarship and earned an MBA at the American University in Cairo. After he graduated in 2007, he started his own company, Oteena, in 2008 which became a distributor and retail consultant for electronic companies in Egypt. After visiting an R&D Center in Korea, Waleed wanted to be the first company in Egypt to design and build electronic parts and sell into Africa. So in 2010, he created Olkya, which produced flash drives and smartphones, and later designed and built the first Egyptian tablet.
Getting the tech industry working together
One of my favorite quotes about leadership comes from America’s sixth president, John Quincy Adams. He said: “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.” For the founders of the Egyptian tech sector, their leadership is shown by the future generation of business leaders they help to empower. For example, Alaa had a much bigger vision than Info Arab; it was important for him not just to build a business but an industry.
So in the 1980s he and a couple of other Egyptian technology founders created the Software Board, which later became the Software Association, of which he was the chair between 1996-2011. He wanted the industry to work together to demonstrate to the international market the power of Egypt’s technology sector. His vision was to get the industry to work together to present its ability to develop cutting-edge technology that would provide value to global markets.
ITWORX, the startup spin-off machine
ITWORX hired the best and wanted employees like Wael and Youssri — engineers who had a curious mind and wanted to solve the world’s problems with technology. To do this they had to create a culture more unique than most traditional Egyptian companies, a culture where it was OK to make mistakes. Engineers at ITWORX had unique opportunities developing different technologies for a diverse number of industries around the world. Whenever an employee wanted to experiment with their own business idea on the side, Wael and Youssri gave them the freedom to do this — and were even willing to give small loans when these employees left to start their own businesses.
 
Because of the culture, there are 48 spin-off tech companies that came from ITWORX, according to a study by Endeavor Insight. This includes Mohamed Rafea, co-founder of Bey2ollak, a crowd-based traffic app that launched during the revolution. Wael and Youssari are no longer part of ITWORX, but continue to support young founders, like Wael Amin, who is now a partner in one of the Middle East’s premier venture capital firms, Sawari Ventures.
Tech startup investor and champion
For more than five years on most Thursday afternoons you could find Dr. Khaled Ismail at his favorite coffee shop on the island of Zamalek mentoring a new startup. Since he sold SySDSoft to Intel he felt obligated to pay it forward and became a full-time mentor and a serious angel investor. For example, one of his investments was in young founder Mostafa Hemdan and his startup RecycloBekia, which is helping to solve the huge waste management problem in Egypt. Like ITWORX, SySDSoft has been a major source of spin-offs, with 23 tech companies being spun out. Ismail has moved from angel investor to venture capitalist and one of the founders of Algebra Ventures, which is the largest VC fund in Egypt.
The development of the startup hacker culture
In many ways, eSpace revolutionized how product development was done in Egypt. For that reason, so many of the people who leave eSpace are some of the most important parts of the startup ecosystem in Egypt. This includes Ramez Mohamed, the CEO of one of the most successful accelerators in the Middle East (Flat6Labs), and Ziad Mokhtar, who is a long-term Egyptian venture capitalist and founded Algebra Ventures with Ismail. Several startups founders were spin-offs from eSpace, like Sabrine Assem and her firm Untap, which is an innovation agency leveraging crowd sourcing.
Super mentor
There is no better mentor for startups than Waleed Khalil. For him, guiding startup helps him. “It helps your business when you help others. Good things and challenges sheds light in other areas, it doesn’t need to be the same industry or the same product. You become smarter.” About 10 of his employees have spun out different firms with Waleed’s encouragement.
The technology sector in Egypt has been a reliant shining light in a country that has had gray clouds since the 2011 revolution. While national GDP growth has been stagnant and only picked up in 2015, the ICT sector has been growing 13 percent per year from 2012 to 2015 and currently is the fastest growing sector in Egypt while growing employment to more than 200,000 people. This is important because Egypt has one of the highest rates of unemployed college-educated professionals in the world, and the technology sector is one of the only industries able to employ these graduates.
This growing and reliant industry would not have happened without the original technology founders from the 1980s and 1990s whose DNA was to solve problems with technology. They ensured their passion and DNA was downloaded to their employees and other founders they mentored. The leadership of Youssri, Wael, Alaa, Youssef, Waleed, Hamdy, Khaled and several others have to lead to the development of an industry that provides economic viability and hope to a country that has struggled to find stability over the last couple of years.",2017-08-31,1531570,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pyramids.jpg?w=738,startups/,"sysdsoft,espace,egypt",Egyptian technology startups stand on the shoulders of giants,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/egyptian-technology-startups-stand-on-the-shoulders-of-giants/
Fitz Tepper,Startups,"dApps, or decentralized apps, are open-source applications built on top of a blockchain. But here’s the thing – users usually can’t interact with these dApps unless they have tokens issued by these projects. For example, both Augur, a decentralized prediction market and REXMLS, a free global listing network for real estate, require tokens to interact with.
But if you didn’t participate in the dApp’s ICO, getting these tokens isn’t easy.
While some tokens trade on exchanges, you’d have to first buy Bitcoin or Ethereum (which still isn’t necessarily easy), send it to an exchange, convert it to the token, then send to token to the dApp. It’s a process, to say the least.
So, enter Dharma, a company part of this summer’s Y Combinator batch.
Dharma wants to let anyone get a small cryptocurrency loan in just a few minutes, so they can use a dApp without going through that long process to acquire a token.
Right now these loans are only denominated in ether (which some dApps accept), but eventually Dharma wants to be able to support the borrowing and lending of any crypto asset. All loans are denominated in USD so neither side is exposed to the volatility risk associated with cryptocurrencies.
Since Dharma is built as an open-source plugin, developers can essentially plug a line of credit directly into their dApp, so users can get tokens to use without ever leaving the platform. Dharma’s protocol can also be accessed without going through a dApp at all, if someone just wanted to borrow a cryptocurrency to use for no specific purpose.
Of course it’s a little lot more complicated than this on the backend.
The loans themselves are peer-to-peer, meaning Dharma isn’t actually loaning you any money – they are just building the open-source protocol to facilitate the borrowing and lending off cryptocurrency. And all loans are represented by Dharma’s own newly issued ERC20-based token, which lives on the Ethereum blockchain.
So how does Dharma make money?
The startup is also handling the credit risk assessment / loan approval process – which is the only aspect of the protocol that is not decentralized. At launch Dharma will collect basic KYC  (know your customer) information from borrowers and decide if the borrower is likely to pay back the loan.
Since loans aren’t collateralized and there is no actual credit check, Dharma will likely limit first-time borrowers to small amounts of cryptocurrency. But over time as users generate solid repayment history they may increase the amount able to be borrowed, which is a model not so different from Affirm. In return for verifying a borrower, Dharma (the startup, not the protocol) will be allocated a certain portion of loan principal as a fee.
Right now Dharma is the only entity that is approved to decide a borrower’s creditworthiness and approve a loan. But eventually they want to permission other entities to step in and approve borrowers – for example, an African TelCo has a lot of information on its users that Dharma doesn’t have, that could be used when deciding to approve them for a loan.
Dharma isn’t totally live yet – but you can try it out on Testnet, which is a faux version of Ethereum’s blockchain just used to test apps. On Testnet Dharma works with Metamask – a chrome plugin that lets you run Ethereum dApps right in your browser and 0x – a decentralized token exchange. But soon Dharma plans to launch on Ethereum’s live network and integrate with many more dApps.

Anthony Ha,Entertainment,"Disruptor Beam has already created games based on Star Trek and Game of Thrones. Next up is The Walking Dead, with the launch of The Walking Dead: March to War.
To build the game, which was first announced last year, the company partnered with Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment. That means the game is technically an adaptation of the comics, but the environments and challenges should feel pretty familiar to TV fans, too.
Not that this is the first mobile game to adapt the ubiquitous zombie franchise — Telltale has released multiple, critically acclaimed Walking Dead adventure titles, while Scopely’s got The Walking Dead: Road to Survival.
Still, I was quite impressed by what Disruptor Beam CEO Jon Radoff demonstrated for me. March to War takes place in the same zombie-overrun United States as the comics — in this case, Washington, D.C.
The team created what Radoff said is a 20-square-mile map of the city. In other words, it’s a big map, but it also has lots of detail, allowing you to recognize landmarks like the White House, and even to spot individual walkers (a.k.a. zombies) moving across the landscape.

You can also interact with characters from the comics like Rick and Negan by adding them to your council, where they’ll advise you on your next move.
And as in the comics, the walkers provide a threat, but the bigger danger comes from other humans. March to War is a multiplayer experience that allows you to form alliances with other players (you’ll have a pretty tough time trying to survive on your own, Radoff said), and then launch raids and attacks on other communities.
The Walking Dead: March to War is available for free on iOS and Android. Radoff said the launch reflects the same philosophy that Disruptor Beam used with Game of Thrones Ascent and Star Trek Timelines — the goal is to win over the most passionate fans of the franchise, and then expand outward from there.
Radoff said this is also happening as the owners of popular entertainment franchises increasingly see games as a way to stay connected to fans, not just to make a quick buck.
“Nothing engages an audience like a long-running game,” he said. “What we build are MMOs that are fundamentally designed to engage people for many, many years.”",2017-08-31,1534397,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/box-art-horizontal-with-white-orange-logo-badges.png?w=738,startups/,"zombies,the-walking-dead,disruptor-beam","Disruptor Beam’s ‘Walking Dead: March to War’ puts you in the middle of a zombified Washington, D.C.",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/disruptor-beams-walking-dead-march-to-war-puts-players-in-the-middle-of-a-zombified-washington-d-c/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"De-cloaking today is a new startup from two of the founders of defunct food delivery company Take Eat Easy. Dubbed Cowboy, the company is building a new electronic bicycle that it claims will address issues that have historically stopped e-bikes from becoming a “fully fledged mobility solution”.
“We haven’t launched yet,” Cowboy co-founder Adrien Roose tells me. “We are still entirely focusing on product development. After six months of design, engineering and industrialisation, we now have a first fully functional prototype. We will keep iterating on the product in the coming months, with the objective to launch early Spring 2018”.
Specifically, the Cowboy bike aims to better previous e-bikes in terms of pricing, product design, and technology — with the broader mission to “improve urban mobility by increasing the popularity of electric bikes”.
Key features include what Roose says is an intuitive and automatic motor assistance, a removable semi-integrated “smart battery,” and an app to turn the bike on and off and support theft detection, including GPS tracking. In addition, Cowboy plans to offer remote troubleshooting and software updates.
The distribution model of Cowboy is a classic online play, too. The startup says it will sell the e-bike through direct channels, allowing for “disintermediated” pricing of €1,399.
“As a digital native vertical brand, we’ve developed our own technology, allowing us to control both product design and production cost. To develop a connection with our customers, and lower prices, we will only distribute our product through direct sales channel,” adds Roose.
Cowboy’s other founders are Karim Slaoui, who along with Roose previously co-founded Brussels and London-based Take East Easy, an early Deliveroo competitor, and Tanguy Goretti, who was previously co-founder and CEO of Djump, an early competitor to Uber Pop in Europe.",2017-08-31,1533510,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cowboybike-21.jpg?w=738,startups/,,Cowboy is a new e-bike startup from founders of Take Eat Easy,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/cowboy-bike/
Anthony Ha,Media,"HowStuffWorks has changed owners more than once in the past few years. Discovery sold the company to Blucora in 2014, and Blucora, in turn, sold it to digital advertising company System1 last year.
Now, however, the nearly 20-year-old digital media brand is spinning out as an independent company. It’s also announcing that it has raised $15 million in Series A funding led by The Raine Group.
Conal Byrne, who was general manager at HowStuffWorks for seven years before taking on an executive role at Discovery, is returning as president. He made it clear that while the company has a “storied past” with explainer articles and videos, it’s now focused on podcasting.
After all, HowStuffWorks already owns popular podcasts like Stuff You Should Know and Stuff You Missed in History Class, and it says its podcasts have received more than 1 billion downloads total, with 375 million of those downloads coming in the past 12 months.
“Over the last decade, we’ve grown into the biggest ad-driven podcast network in the world without being able to laser focus on podcasting,” Byrne said. By spinning out, the company should be able to “take a serious run at this.”
That means adding another 15 to 20 podcasts in the next year. Byrne said, “Each show will be its own thing, but no matter what, it will be shot through with the core HowStuffWorks values of the pursuit of knowledge and authenticity.”
He also argued that podcasts presents a unique opportunity for advertising, because they provide “an incredibly intimate type of content.”
Raine Group Vice President Pete Amaro (who’s pictured above with Byrne and Jason Hoch, HowStuffWorks’ head of new initiatives) added that while his firm had been concerned about the size of the podcasting market, the past year has been a “watershed moment” for the industry — accelerating demand from both consumers and advertisers has put those doubts to rest.

Catherine Shu,Gadgets,"When Google Home was unveiled, many people immediately noted the smart speaker’s striking resemblance to a home fragrance diffuser. Now there’s a smart home fragrance diffuser that looks like a smart speaker. Pium, a self-described “next-generation smart diffuser,” is currently participating in Samsung Electronic’s Creative Square incubator program. Visitors to IFA 2017 can demo it at Samsung’s booth. Pium also recently ran a successful Kickstarter campaign.
While other diffusers that can be controlled with a mobile app already exist, Pium’s creators say they see their product as a gateway to a new user interface experience. In fact, the startup is already exploring ways to use its technology in virtual reality platforms, too.
Pium comes in two styles (the Brooklyn, which looks very much like a smart speaker, and the more diffuser-ish Chelsea) and can be voice-operated with actual smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo. It is also compatible with Philips Hue smart lightbulbs and Sonos speakers.
The company was founded by Ryan Kihm, Jay Hwang and Wes Yoon. Before launching Pium, Kihm and Hwang worked on the invention team of a Seoul-based accelerator, helping early-stage startups develop their IP portfolios. While doing research, the two determined that olfaction, or the sense of smell, is set to become the subject of “the next big UX technology,” Kihm told TechCrunch in an email.
“The U.S. home fragrance market is about $6 billion, but still customers just rely on their personal preferences and advertisements to pick a product. Many options are on the market, but people still don’t know how to choose one,” he said.
Scented candles often contain potentially harmful ingredients like benzene, but essential oils can also be confusing to use. Pium’s software analyzes data to understand what associations people attach to different aromas and make personalized recommendations. Its diffuser uses pods pre-filled with essential oil blends. Kihm says this not only give Pium a source of continuous revenue after selling the diffuser, but is also more convenient for its customers because they don’t have to mix oils themselves or clean their Piums.
Just as importantly, pods also let Pium have more control over user experience. Pium’s system selects different scents to release based on the time of day (for example, it can diffuse lavender-based scents at night before switching to something more invigorating in the morning) and detects its users’ locations so it can turn on automatically before they arrive home.
In the future, Pium also plans to offer a subscription service that automatically ships new blends to customers when their pods start running low. The diffusers are currently available for pre-order and are being tested at Bodyfriend HQ, a cafe and lounge in Seoul.",2017-08-30,1534234,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/brooklyn.jpg?w=738,startups/,"fragrance,diffuser",Pium’s smart diffuser wants to design a new user experience for your nose,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/pium/
Anthony Ha,eCommerce,"Booze delivery startup Thirstie is adding a new twist to its model — it’s working directly with alcohol brands, starting with Dom Pérignon, to offer on-demand delivery.
When we wrote about Thirstie back in 2015, the startup allowed consumers to buy alcohol from nearby stores that already made deliveries. Co-founder and CEO Devaraj Southworth said Thirstie will continue to offer this consumer service (where it competes with other startups like Minibar). But his focus has shifted elsewhere.
“We set off on a slightly different strategy, looking at a more enterprise or B2B solution,” Southworth said. “A lot of it had to do with capital efficiency” — rather than launching expensive marketing campaigns to attract consumers, Thirstie can leverage the name recognition of a brand like Dom Pérignon.
In this case, Dom Pérignon is testing out a service where consumers (starting in New York and Miami) should be able to order a bottle directly from the Dom Pérignon website and get it delivered within an hour.
“A continuation of the Moët Hennessy USA ambition of innovation in the market, the launch of a 1-hour luxury delivery service for Dom Pérignon presents a new avenue in which to delight the Dom Pérignon consumer, in the on-demand and immediate world they live in,” said Dom Pérignon vice president Jorge Cosano in the announcement.
Southworth said Thirstie built the underlying e-commerce platform powering these transactions, while fulfillment gets handled by stores in the Thirstie network.
He added that while Thirstie partners don’t mind the additional sales, the real benefit is in the data, which could allow brands to better measure the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns and understand consumer taste. Eventually, he suggested brands could even follow the “Netflix model” and “create new product offerings based on the data.”",2017-08-30,1534061,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/3994803605_42b189fdd9_b.jpg?w=738,startups/,"dom-perignon,thirstie",Thirstie is powering on-demand delivery for Dom Pérignon,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/thirstie-is-powering-on-demand-delivery-for-dom-perignon/
Matthew Lynley,Apps,"Dropbox continues to tune its products as it tries to tap a bigger audience within larger companies with some updates today to its collaboration tool Paper, including the ability to preview documents before loading them.
As a blank slate, Paper is increasingly popular with designers you might talk to in Silicon Valley. It basically turns the process of designing and building a product spec into a living, breathing flow of information online. As such, Dropbox seems to have started to recognize the opportunity of catering to these users as it starts the drip-drip-drip of incremental product updates to suit those popular needs.
Here’s a quick rundown of what’s getting updated today: users are able to create folders on their mobile devices and move Paper documents into them; they can now delete or archive their Paper documents on their phones; finally, users can now preview Paper documents before opening them. All of these seem to be on the smallish side, but they’re worth noting as Dropbox is a company that touts its simplicity and has to take care not to feature creep a product like Paper.
Dropbox is also giving developers a way to create or edit Paper documents in their own apps, which is a move that will potentially move the product outside of the bounds of the traditional Dropbox experience. But this is also important because it gives third parties which are accustomed to working on these kinds of documents in their own environments a way to do that with Dropbox.
That’s a perpetual danger for any company that tries to lean on its brand as a simpler product, especially as the company tries to break into a mainstream enterprise tool that has to cater to dozens of different team requirements. Dropbox’s challenge is building a more generalized, abstract version of the collaboration tools you might find in other massive products.
It’s going to need to do just that as the company seems increasingly primed for an IPO. The company is reportedly following all the incremental steps toward going public. It’s inevitably going to be compared to companies like Box or Microsoft, but with an origin story as a consumer product, it has to provide a unique pitch if it looks to become a full-fledged business that’s able to tap both consumer and enterprise demand.",2017-08-30,1533753,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dropbox-paper-beta.png?w=738,startups/,paper,Dropbox Paper gets document previews and some other small updates,"microsoft,box,dropbox-inc",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/dropbox-paper-gets-document-previews-and-some-other-small-updates/
Frederic Lardinois,Advertising Tech,"Adwerx is a well-known advertising and re-targeting network for real estate agents (though if you’re not in that line of business, chances are you’ve never heard of it, of course). The Durham, NC-based company today announced that it has raised a $4.3 million funding round led by Grotech Ventures, with participation from Bull City Venture Partners and Alerion Ventures.
The company, which was spun off from ReverbNation in 2014, plans to use the new funding to expand beyond the real estate vertical. “The first opportunity we found was in real estate, and as we work to deepen that traction, we naturally looked to adjacent verticals as well,” the company’s CEO Jed Carlson told me. “The Adwerx mission is to provide brilliantly simple digital advertising to anybody that wants to use it.”
Some of the verticals Adwerx is currently looking at are automotive, dental practices, home services, law offices, restaurants, salons and spas. The company also offers its services in verticals like insurance and mortgage that closely align with the real estate business.
All of these, just like the real estate focus that gave Adwerx its start, tend to center around specific geographies and just like Adwerx already allows its real estate clients to target potential customers by zip code, these new verticals also tend to be of interest to advertisers who want to target consumers in specific geographies. Adwerx helps them create their ads and then places them on various networks, including Facebook and Google.
All of this may sound really familiar and Adwerx is going up against industry heavyweights that already serve all of the same verticals. Carlson seems relatively undaunted by this. “Internally, we talk about Adwerx being ‘Access Tech’ instead of ‘Ad Tech,’ and that’s an important distinction,” he said. “Adwerx is the bridge for small businesses that want to do digital advertising but may be daunted by the process.  We’ve worked incredibly hard to simplify the process of creative, targeting, and running digital ads across multiple platforms – including the heavyweights like Google and Facebook.”
The company says that it has now worked with over 50,000 real estate agents and other small businesses. It has also recently launched an enterprise program for working with large agencies and brought on RE/MAX, @properties and others as clients for this service.
Adwerx raised $1.25 million after it was spun out of ReverbNation. This new round brings the company’s total funding to $5.55 million.",2017-08-30,1533723,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-528851357.jpg?w=738,startups/,"real-estate,advertising",Adtech startup Adwerx raises $4.3M as it looks to expand beyond real estate,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/ad-tech-startup-adwerx-raises-4-3m-as-it-looks-to-expand-beyond-real-estate/
Ron Miller,Enterprise,"As blockchains begin to gain in popularity, a need is developing to enable them to communicate with one another. That would require a networking infrastructure to facilitate that communication, and that’s precisely what Nuco, a Toronto-based startup is trying to do with the release of the Aion blockchain network today.
Nuco CEO Matthew Spoke says that while each network is ultimately responsible for building its own level of trust within its blockchain, once you start to move outside the realm of your private blockchain as banks, governments, healthcare providers and anyone else working with this kind of data is inevitably going to do, you need a system to make that happen. Nuco built Aion to provide that mechanism.
He says that at its core, Aion becomes the plumbing to move data around. “[Aion provides the] middleware for blockchains to communicate with each other, and the ability to pass messages between them,” he says.
Spoke, who along with his co-founders, were originally part of the blockchain team at Deloitte, formed the company last year to begin building enterprise blockchain infrastructure, but they began to realize that while many large organizations were building private blockchains, there was a growing need for a public mechanism. As the blockchain concept begins to scale and becomes an integral part of the economic system, it requires a generic way of moving information.
There are a couple of major hurdles to get people to build and use a system like this. First of all, they have to convince organizations to move information between blockchains in a public way. Second, it requires a single way to move that information, a kind of networking protocol. Once they agree to the former, the latter becomes an inevitable requirement.
Companies can find a way to monetize their participation on the network by charging Aion tokens, a type of digital currency, to move certain kinds of data across inter-chain bridges. This ability could lure more companies to move to the network, Spoke explained.
That said, he sees Aion as a market necessity, not something they are looking to commercialize in a direct way. At some point blockchain will hit mainstream adoption and it will require mature infrastructure for his company and others to succeed. Spoke says his company is making this contribution to help the market grow.
While Nuco isn’t the only company working on this problem, Spoke is convinced that a process like this is required, and that like any technology, the market will decide which approach wins and becomes the standard.",2017-08-30,1533563,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-676434248.jpg?w=738,startups/,"blockchains,network",Nuco’s Aion network provides a way to communicate between multiple blockchains,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/nucos-aion-network-provides-a-way-to-communicate-between-multiple-blockchains/
Megan Rose Dickey,Startups,"Before Uber poached Dara Khosrowshahi to serve as its CEO, he facilitated a $26 million series B round in hotel startup ALICE as CEO of Expedia. The idea with ALICE is to bring technology to the outdated hotel industry by offering up a system to run hotels on a single platform.
This round brings ALICE’s total funding to $39 million and makes Expedia the startup’s majority shareholder. Last January, the startup raised a $9.5 million Series A round, also led by Expedia.
ALICE, which has customers like Triumph Hotels, Sixty Hotels and Nylo Hotels, offers services like check-in, requests for amenities and room service, communication with the concierge and more. In the last six months, ALICE says it’s grown its hotel customer base nearly 200 percent.
Although ALICE is by far the most well-funded startup in this space, it’s facing increasing competition from other young tech companies. In August, startup Aavgo launched its service to enable communication between hotel guests and hotel staff. Aavgo has only $1 million in funding. With this funding, ALICE says it will be able to make some key hires across its development, product sales and customer success teams.
Expedia did not make Khosrowshahi available for comment, but Expedia President of Lodging Partner Services Cyril Ranque was able to chime in.
“It is time for the internet to expand beyond revolutionizing how our hotel partners market and distribute their products into how they work and treat their guests,” Ranque said in a statement. “ALICE is developing smart mobile and cloud technology to fundamentally improve the hotelier and guest experience at scale. That’s a revolution worth investing in.”
Expedia has also invested in online travel portal Traveloka, on-demand car service startup Wingz, Brazil-based flights and hotel platform Decolar and Room 77, which was acquired by Lola Travel Company in 2016.
Here’s a quick look at ALICE.

Steve O'Hear,Europe,"There seems to be no end to the number of startups operating in the travel and accommodation space. These range from online travel agencies, hotel booking sites and aggregators, to companies that help hotels fight back in an attempt to get more direct bookings. And of course there is Airbnb and its ilk.
One growing sector we can add to the travel accommodation list is long term stays for business travelers. Enter Cologne-based Homelike, founded in 2015 by Dustin Figge and Christoph Kasper. The German startup targets business travelers who need “long-stay” accommodation of a month or more and for which a hotel doesn’t really cut it. Citing growing demand from both the supply and demand side, the startup has just raised €4 million in Series A funding led by Cherry Ventures, with participation from existing backer Coparion.
“Due to many international work assignments, Christoph and I used to work and live abroad for several months with stays in China, the U.S, and some European cities. Eventually we were both tired of staying in hotels with limited privacy and without a ‘home away from home’ feeling,” explains Figge, Homelike’s CEO.
“Furnished apartments were more comfortable, flexible and also significantly cheaper than hotel rooms. We both liked it way more than hotels! However, it was anything but easy to find a suitable apartment and book it online from a remote location. That was the point, the idea for Homelike, and thus our business was born”.
As the pair began to scope out the startup’s product, Figge says it became more evident how underserved business travel is within the apartment rental market. At the same time, companies increasingly require employees to relocate temporarily as part of their work for weeks if not months on end.
“Also companies themselves are trying to cut accommodation costs rapidly these days,” he adds. “They spend about 25 per cent of their business travel costs on overnight stays. When it comes to prolonged periods, furnished apartments are, in most cases, a 40 per cent more cost-effective solution in comparison to hotels. Including added benefits of being more comfortable and flexible. Simultaneously, the temporary housing market is growing rapidly by 20 per cent year over year and is becoming much more professional”.
To take advantage — and feed — this trend, Homelike offers an entirely online and “no friction” booking experience for furnished apartments for long stays. This includes a secure booking process, corporate travel policies (such as VAT invoicing), and a user experience it says is designed to cater to the needs of corporates.
Furthermore, Figge says that apartment providers prefer Homelike because they can easily list their entire inventory online. “After the apartments have been verified based on our quality standards, the landlord can relax knowing that we take care of the whole process end-to-end, including the billing and transactional process. We are the only platform which provides a digital rental agreement that is signed by both parties, skipping the traditional process of printing and sending a paper copy back and forth,” he explains.
More broadly — and something that likely attracted Cherry — is that the rental market is generally shifting towards the direction of furnished and serviced living. “Similar to the shifts we are experiencing in transport and mobility, we believe that the rental market will develop towards a ‘living-as-a-service model’,” says Figge.
Finally, I’m told there is another piece to the Homelike play: data. This is seeing the startup generate what it claims to be a significant amount of data around rental prices, the best locations, the best floor plans, etc — data it reckons will enable Homelike to vertically integrate further with developers that are building new and proprietary supply that is tailored to the business travel segment.",2017-08-30,1533077,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/homelike_founders1.jpg?w=738,startups/,cherry-ventures,"Homelike, a German startup that lets business travelers find an apartment, picks up €4M Series A",,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/homelike/
Steve O'Hear,Europe,"Veo, a Copenhagen-based startup, wants to “democratise the recording of football”. By taking advantage of developments in AI and video camera technology, the company offers a solution for amateur soccer clubs that want to video and stream matches and training sessions without the need for a camera operator or vision mixer/editor.
The Veo camera mount consists of two 4K cameras encased within a 3D-printed box, designed to be positioned on a four-metre tripod just outside of the pitch’s halfway line. The cameras then record a 180-degree panoramic view of the full pitch, with the resulting image stitched together and the AI-tech working hard to follow the action via virtual panning and zooming on the resulting recording video file.
That, of course, means that a portion of the image will often be cropped out, resulting in a loss of resolution overall. However, the idea is that by starting with 4K the resulting video quality is more than sufficient, not least for playback on smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets.
“Today, less than 1 per cent of all football matches are recorded,” says Veo co-founder and CEO Henrik Teisbæk. “This is because in order to record a football match properly, you need a cameraman to be filming from an elevated position for 90 mins, and then be able to edit the footage afterwards. Most teams simply don’t have the resources required for this, meaning that millions of goals and unique footballing moments are never viewed or shared by the players”.

To get around this, Teisbæk says Veo’s AI technology can detect where the action is on the field, and automatically zoom and pan to follow the ball – just like a camera operator would do. “We have spent nearly two years developing the technology to detect where on the pitch a camera operator would point and zoom,” he explains.
“Using deep neural networks and computer vision, our tech can now track the ball and players with consistency and precision. This is combined with advanced video editing techniques, so we can zoom and pan inside the full panoramic video and ‘crop’ out the relevant part”.
Despite the aforementioned loss of quality, the advantage of this approach is that the Veo cameras can record from a static position, and don’t need to pan and tilt during the recording. It also means coaches and players can manually create their own edits after the match, by choosing the virtual camera angle and where to zoom.
“Since the zooming is done digitally, the output pixel quality is reduced. However it’s important to stress that the recordings are not meant for professional TV broadcasting and that the reduced video quality format works really well on devices with smaller screens,” reiterates Teisbæk.
The startup’s business model is based on subscription fees from football clubs. The entry camera subscription will starts from £999 annually. Clubs can upgrade to embed their local sponsors’ logos onto the match videos and highlights, which could also provide those clubs with a welcome additional revenue stream.
Meanwhile, I’m told Veo has raised a total of €2 million in seed funding to date, with Copenhagen-based Seed Capital most recently investing €1.1 million in April 2017. The remaining €900,000 came via angel investors including: David Fellah (Founder of Designit); Per Zachariassen (Founder of Blu and Skylark); Henrik Hancke (Founder of Blu and Skylark); and Kasper Wedendahl (Founder of Bacon).",2017-08-30,1532848,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tripod.jpg?w=738,startups/,,Veo uses AI to let amateur soccer clubs video matches without the need for a camera operator,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/veo/
Darrell Etherington,Mobile,"The newest version of Android (Oreo, officially) doesn’t bring a ton of new stuff to the mobile operating system, but it does overhaul something near and dear to most smartphone user’s hearts: Emoji. Google has done away with its “blob” style smileys in favor of more traditional-looking (I guess?) smileys, and emoji that in general look more recognizable when compared with their equivalents on other platforms, including iOS.
Google announced its emoji redesign back at I/O, its annual developer conference, so we’ve had time to grieve the blobs, but it’s still going to hurt for some fans of the offbeat Google pictographs. Google also seems to have good intentions for the redesign — it wants to both unify the style for a library that has grown immensely since its inception and Better represent diversity and inclusivity among its emoji set.
One of its stated goals with this huge overhaul was also to improve communication across platforms. Strange as it might seem to old-school phone users who remember when people used to communicate using voice and text, emoji are actually used often to convey real meaning. Google says it wanted to help avoid miscommunication by helping to make sure emoji are as consistent as possible when used across platforms: Those blobs often seemed to mean very different things from their iOS equivalents.
Android O also includes 69 new emoji, as included in the Unicode 10 emoji set. These are focused on better representation of people and gender, as well as some fun fantasy and sci-fi characters and the likely very popular exploding head emoji.

The samples of emoji above are just a small taste of the complete redesign introduced in Android O, which include more than 2,000 characters in total. If you want a full sampling, go ahead and check out Emojipedia for the whole enchilada, which is something there is no emoji for (yet).",2017-08-21,1529003,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/1-shpv5hx-voeaxvpfiokaaw.png?w=738,mobile/,"android-oreo,android-o",Meet Android Oreo’s all-new emoji,"android,google",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/meet-android-oreos-all-new-emoji/
Darrell Etherington,Mobile,"The latest version of Android is officially here, and it’s called Android Oreo, as most people suspected. Google made the interesting decision to reveal the final name and consumer launch details of Android 8.0 coincidentally with the arrival of the solar eclipse over NYC, which is where it held its launch live stream today.
Google has traditionally used sweet treats for the names of its major Android releases, dating back to Android 1.5, aka “Cupcake.” KitKat (4.4) was the last branded release, with Google typically sticking to generic dessert names wherever possible. Oreo is pretty much the only choice for an “O” dessert that’s broadly and instantly recognizable, however, so it seems like it was almost inevitable.
Here’s what Oreo contains: The foundational cookie sandwich pieces are likely the boot speed and memory improvements Google made by changing the way the operating system works at a basic level to boost Pixel smartphone start times by up to 100 percent, and to improve the efficiency of use of system resources among apps and background tasks.

For the creamy filling, we have picture-in-picture, which allows you to run video apps on top of other tasks, on both phones and tablets. There’s also now Android Instant Apps, which provide access to apps instantly without requiring a download for limited interactivity; notification dots, which tell you when there’s activity within a specific app with a dot in the corner; and autofill for apps, which is like the feature on the web but for individual Android applications.
Android O also ships with more security features, including remote location, locking and wiping with Find My Device, and Google Play Protect, which scans for, detects and automatically deletes malicious apps on a daily basis.
Finally, Google has completely overhauled their emoji set, which is a big change for the primary language of millennial users everywhere.
Android O is rolling out to Pixel and Nexus 5X/6P devices soon, Google says, and anyone on the preview will be updated to the final version, as well. Pixel C and Nexus Player are next up for official updates, too, with other devices to follow shortly.

Romain Dillet,Apps,"Apple just dropped a brand new beta for iOS 11. And you know that iOS 11 is going to be your favorite major iOS update of the year, as there’s only one per year. The company has been testing iOS 11 for a couple of months already. Don’t forget that the beta program is primarily targeted at developers working on app updates.
I still wouldn’t recommend installing iOS 11 on the iPhone you use every day. The changes in iOS 11 will take some time to pay off for your iPhone anyway. And beta versions of iOS usually drain your battery life.
If you’re already running iOS 11, head over to the Settings app of your iPhone or iPad to update. macOS High Sierra, watchOS 4 and tvOS 11 also received a beta update today.
Today’s beta is only available to developers who pay $99 a year to access new betas, developer tools and content. If you’re not a developer, you can also join the (free) public beta program; you’ll receive the same update in a day or two, once Apple knows for sure that the beta isn’t going to destroy your device.
At this point, if you have an iPad and you don’t spend hours using it every day, you could install the public beta of iOS 11 to see what it looks like. Unlike on the iPhone, iOS 11 is going to drastically change your iPad.
iOS 11 turns your iPad into a more capable tablet as you can drag and drop files, app icons and more across the operating system. There’s even a dock, a new app switcher and a Files app so you can launch apps and manage your documents more easily.
And if you don’t have an iPad, most of the changes are under the hood, starting with Apple’s augmented reality framework ARKit. Many developers have been working on ARKit-enabled apps. It should foster augmented reality apps in the App Store. There’s also a completely redesigned Control Center with customizable shortcuts.
If Apple follows the same pattern as in previous years, iOS 11 is going to be available a week after the introduction of the new iPhone. The next iPhone is likely going to be announced in early September. If you don’t want to install iOS 11 just yet and want to see what iOS 11 looks like, I wrote a preview of the upcoming changes.",2017-08-21,1529111,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ios-11-preview.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"ios-11,ios",Apple just shared iOS 11 beta 7 to developers,apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/apple-just-shared-ios-11-beta-7-to-developers/
Brian Heater,Mobile,"The arrival of a new Android version isn’t nearly as rare as a total solar eclipse, but Google’s hoping the solar system will share the spotlight as it takes the wraps off its latest mobile operating system. Among other things, Android O will likely be getting an official release date and alphabetic dessert name, with “Oreo” looking like the top contender. 
So, how does the current Android landscape shake out? Fragmentation will almost certainly continue to be a concern for the Android ecosystem. That’s just the nature of the beast when you’re dealing with an open operating system and countless different manufacturers, each with their own Google partnerships, customizations and security focuses. But things actually seem to be heading in the right direction since the last time we checked in.

Back in November, we noted that Gingerbread, Android’s 2011 version, had a wider distribution than Nougat, the latest version, released earlier in the year. But Nougat has made up a decent amount of ground since then. According to numbers collected by the Android Developers Dashboard earlier this month, the two versions of the operating system (7.0 and 7.1) make up about 13.5 percent of the market, with 7.0 comprising the vast majority. That’s up from around 0.3 percent of the total market.
Marshmallow (6.0), meanwhile, has leapfrogged Lollipop (5.0/5.1), to make up just under a third of the market, at 32.3 percent, to its predecessor’s 29.2. Keep in mind, Marshmallow is a two-year-old operating system, so it’s not exactly bleeding edge, but this is certainly a step in the right direction.

We’ve already seen a fair number of O(reo)’s features, courtesy of a beta release, and, honestly, it’s not the most exciting Android update — a fact that could mean people aren’t going to be rushing to upgrade. There are still some important questions that will hopefully get answered today, however, including which devices will be the first in line to be upgraded. 
With IFA coming up in a few weeks, we may also soon see the first devices to ship with the new Android out of the box.

Romain Dillet,Finance,"Apple and Google could be the biggest frenemies in tech. While they both compete like there’s no tomorrow, they also partner on some very specific deals. For instance, Google is paying a ton of money to remain the default search engine on iOS.
As CNBC first reported, according to a Bernstein analyst, Google could pay as much as $3 billion a year just to remain the default option in Safari.
Business Insider also obtained that Bernstein report and shared the thinking behind this number. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi starts from a previous court document from 2014 that stated that Google had to pay $1 billion every year to remain the default search engine on iOS back in 2014.
But mobile traffic as well as iPhone sales have been growing steadily since then. If you look at Apple’s services revenue, and in particular licensing revenue, as well as Google’s traffic acquisition costs, that number could be around $3 billion right now.
It shows that Google is still highly dependent from Apple. The vast majority of Google’s revenue comes from ads on search result pages. And Apple controls roughly 18 percent of the smartphone market.
As most users update to the latest version of iOS in just a few months, it doesn’t take long to change the default setting on hundreds of millions of iPhones. Google has no choice but to spend a ton of money to acquire this traffic.
A few years ago, the iPhone shipped with a built-in YouTube app and Google Maps. When Apple realized that Google was becoming a serious competitor with Android, the company removed the YouTube app from iOS and worked on Apple Maps. Apple isn’t afraid of saying no to Google when it comes to iOS features.
Apple could probably not get as much money from Microsoft Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, but Apple doesn’t really need it anyway as it brings more than $45 billion in revenue per quarter now. It’s all about hurting Google’s bottom line.
As John Gruber noted, Apple is in a strong position in this negotiation. While it’s true that DuckDuckGo and Bing have gotten better over the years, it still lags behind when you’re using those search engines in non-English languages.
This incongruous situation is a great example of asynchronous competition. Apple and Google keep innovating and competing as hard as they can on the smartphone front. But they also partner on other aspects and even pay each other. Business schools will turn this situation into a great case study.",2017-08-20,1528867,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/safari-ios.jpeg?w=738,mobile/,safari,Google needs to pay Apple a small fortune to remain the default search engine on iOS,"google,apple",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/20/google-needs-to-pay-apple-a-small-fortune-to-remain-the-default-search-engine-on-ios/
Natasha Lomas,Apps,"The startup behind the Prisma style transfer app is shifting focus onto the b2b space, building tools for developers that draw on its expertise using neural networks and deep learning technology to power visual effects on mobile devices.
It’s launched a new website, Prismalabs.ai, detailing this new offering.
Initially, say Prisma’s co-founders, they’ll be offering an SDK for developers wanting to add effects like style transfer and selfie lenses to their own apps — likely launching an API mid next week.
Then, in the “next month or so”, they also plan to offer another service for developers wanting help to port their code to mobile. This was, after all, how the co-founders originally came up with the idea for the Prisma app — having seen a style transfer effect working (slowly) on a desktop computer and realized how much potential it would have if it could be made to work in near real-time on mobile.
“The first plan is ready to go solution when you have an idea and want to implement, for example, style transfer or object recognition or something like face masks… or Snapchat lenses,” says CEO and co-founder Alexey Moiseenkov, fleshing out what’s coming from Prisma Labs. “If you need this ability we can offer you a ready to go SDK that you can implement in your app.”
Co-founder Aram Airapetyan gives an example of how their AI-powered image segmentation technology could also be used to allow users of Skype — for example —  to push a button to change or blank out the background during a video call. (Meaning this wouldn’t have to happen, for example.)
The wave of augmented reality apps that are coming down the smartphone pipe, driven by more powerful hardware and active encouragement from mobile platforms, could also help generate demand for Prisma’s effects, reckons Moiseenkov, as they can offer object tracking as well as face tracking via APIs or an SDK.
“The second part [of the b2b offering] is we feel that in a lot of companies developers are struggling with porting technologies to mobile,” he continues. “And we feel that we can offer them our own solution that we use internally — internally we have… a platform that can help us to experiment with our research and producing a lot of demo apps for internal usage and choosing the right one.”
They say they’ve been testing the developer tools with “some very big companies” — but won’t name any names as yet.
“We want to explore the CV [computer vision] area and help companies also produce a greater user experience with AI — helping people to communicate easier, to solve their tasks,” adds Moiseenkov.
“We feel that AI can help a lot of companies to improve the user experience a lot. The camera, working with images, filtering, de-noising, a lot of different stuff can happen — and that’s cool. I feel it can improve the overall quality of apps in App Store and Google Play.”
Prisma’s consumer app shot to painterly popularity last summer, offering smartphone users the ability to transform a standard smartphone photo by quickly and easily applying different graphical styles — to create, for example, a pastiche of a particular artwork or graphical effect.
The app achieved its effects not by applying filters to the photo but by utilizing neural networks and deep learning to process the original photo in the chosen style — generating a new image that combined both input sources.
By December last year, Prisma had racked up around 70 million downloads and earned itself a bunch of app store accolades. But it also attracted the attention of platform giants like Facebook who quickly rolled out style transfer features of their own — helping to cap the app’s momentum.
The team then experimented with adding social elements to the style transfer tool, to see if they could turn Prisma into a social platform in its own right — although, given how dominated the consumer social/messaging space is, by giants like Facebook and WeChat, that always looked like a forlorn hope.
Branching into b2b looks a more solid strategic step for Prisma, positioning the team to offer developers an accelerated route for burnishing the feature-set/UX of their own apps, and selling these b2b services with the help of demonstrable AI-powered visual effects expertise.
So although Prisma is shifting its monetization strategy (likely a usage-based SDK for the visual effects; and maybe a licensing model for the platform, it says), its consumer apps aren’t going away. Indeed, they now double as both testing ground and showcase for what its tech can do for other developers.
“Since the start of this year we were thinking about exploring our opportunities in terms of how to earn money in an efficient way, and we decided to go where we can help companies with computer vision or AI — in terms of more consumer-oriented applications,” Moiseenkov tells TechCrunch.
“We focus on effects; video effects on a mobile camera… We feel this is a really rich area for a company like ours. And also we feel that with our apps in the market we can experiment a lot with different technologies and this pairing can do a lot for us in terms of earning money.”
“We have a very strong R&D team,” adds Airapetyan. “We have lots of guys who are researching and investigating what we can do in terms of different technologies and AI-based products so we’ve been working on these technologies for a while.”
The team launched a second consumer app in July: a sticker-maker called Sticky that uses AI algorithms to perform quick cut-outs of selfies so they can be easily repurposed as colorful stickers.
Across both apps they say they’re getting between 5M to 10M MAUs [monthly active users] and ~500,000 DAUs [daily active users] at this point — with Airapetyan describing their user base as “very stable”.
Prisma’s own team is around 25-strong, split between offices in the Bay Area and Moscow. Though they say they’re also eyeing setting up a base in China — seeing “huge” potential to sell AI-related services in such a large and visually engaged app ecosystem.
The team has previously raised seed funding, although it has never disclosed how much. According to Crunchbase investors in its seed include Gagarin Capital Partners, Haxus and Nikolai Oreshkin. (Notably Haxus was also an investor in Fabby, a computer vision app recently acquired by Google.)
Moiseenkov says Prisma hasn’t raised any funding since the end of last year, and is not currently looking to raise — they want to see how their b2b play plays out first, he adds.
On the competition front for b2b CV/AI tools, he points to a couple of big companies in Asia offering similar services already — such as Face++.  He also name checks Clarifai as another competitor offering image recognition, as well as Google’s image processing APIs — though he claims Google isn’t offering developers a lot of choice vs the plan for Prisma Labs.
“We are working on a very, very wide-range of AI-based technologies,” adds Airapetyan.",2017-08-19,1528433,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/photo-18-08-2017-22-56-40.jpg?w=738,mobile/,"visual-effects,style-transfer,ai,prisma",Prisma shifts focus to b2b with an API for AI-powered mobile effects,,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/19/prisma-shifts-focus-to-b2b-with-an-api-for-ai-powered-mobile-effects/
